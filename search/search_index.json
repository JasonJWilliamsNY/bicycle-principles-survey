Short-format training (SFT) \u2014 including workshops, bootcamps, and short courses \u2014 is a solution many turn to. However, the effectiveness of SFT is lower than many realize.

Support integration of diagnostic assessment into SFT \ud83d\udd17 Summary: \ud83d\udd17 Assessment 1 promotes effective instruction in SFT and provides evidence that learning objectives are met by learners. Assessments (e.g., exercises, homework, quizzes) which take place during the learning process to facilitate instructor and learner diagnosis of the process of learning are formative or diagnostic. Assessment (e.g., final exams, lab practicals) at the end of an instructional unit, used to demonstrate that learning has been achieved, are summative. SFT generally lacks formal diagnostic assessment. The short duration of SFT may disincentivize the inclusion of diagnostic assessment, but SFT instructors may also lack training and experience in designing effective diagnostic assessments that are feasible for short time frames. For example, diagnostic assessment can be done before the course begins with data collected at time of course registration that helps us understand learning goals as well as lived and professional experiences of attendees. Diagnostic assessments are an accepted best practice for effective instruction, and instructors need to be supported in multiple ways to understand and leverage this practice. How might this work: \ud83d\udd17 Training has been developed to help SFT instructors understand the value of diagnostic assessment and how to integrate actionable assessments into their teaching. This training has been added to basic \u201chow to develop and deliver\u201d SFT , and implemented effectively and consistently to global volunteer instructors for years. Open resources (such as those that already exist from The Carpentries) for developing and utilizing diagnostic assessments can reduce instructor burden in designing their own, but instructors still need to learn about the importance and utility of diagnostic assessment, and some may need to learn how to deploy and interpret it. Examples of success include increasing numbers of instructors developing and including diagnostic assessment and documenting how results prompt them to adjust their teaching. Related Principles \ud83d\udd17 Effective Benefits to the learners \ud83d\udd17 Learners can learn to diagnose their strengths and weaknesses, assess their progress, target areas for improvement, and identify what they may need to learn next. Instructors who recognize the importance and utility of diagnostic assessment make learners true partners in learning. Learners are more engaged when they are actively participating through multiple diagnostic assessment tasks where performance is improving. Repeated diagnostic assessment can demonstrate objectively to learners that they actually changed from unable to able to solve a problem. Incentives to Implementers \ud83d\udd17 Training SFT instructors can encourage greater uptake of diagnostic assessment. Sharing existing resources for diagnostic assessment in the SFT context would reduce instructor implementation burden. Instructors have a better understanding of where instruction needs to be adjusted or supplemented. Instructors can have increased confidence that learners are achieving learning objectives. Barriers to Implementation \ud83d\udd17 The idea and deployment of diagnostic assessment may seem disruptive to SFT instructors and learners. Funding, evaluation expertise, and time will be needed to develop general resources for diagnostic assessment in SFT . Although much is already known about effective diagnostic assessment, SFT in life sciences is a diverse landscape. There is no \u201cone assessment fits all\u201d approach. Instructors will need support in finding balance between covering material in time available and integrating assessments. Training must also train instructors to adjust their instruction in response to assessment feedback. Effective diagnostic assessment depends to some extent on group size. This complicates the development, deployment, and use of diagnostic assessment by learners and instructors alike. Assessments should also be interesting for learners to use (e.g., incorporating culture or local context where possible). These are difficult to develop.
