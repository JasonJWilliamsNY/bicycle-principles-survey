About the Principles Life science is rapidly increasing in interdisciplinarity, making career-spanning learning critical. New methods and deeper research questions requires scientists and educators to traverse widening skill gaps to remain competent. Short-format training (SFT) \u2014 including workshops, bootcamps, and short courses \u2014 is a solution many turn to. However, the effectiveness of SFT is lower than many realize. Overall, SFT is delivered without sufficient grounding in evidence-based pedagogy, and systemic inequity limits inclusion of all learners. The Bicycle Principles assemble education science and community experience into a framework for improving short-format training (SFT) through two cyclic (hence \"bi-cycle\") and iterative processes: The Bicycle Principles for Short Format Training \ud83d\udd17 Core Principles - apply to all short-format training and are grounded in research and work in education, diversity, equity, and inclusion: All Short-format training should... Use Best Evidence ; grounded in best available evidence-based practices from education research and community consensus. Promote Catalytic Learning; consider how to prepare learners to implement new knowledge and where appropriate, position learners to be self-directed. Be Effective ; provide evidence to learners that they have made progress in achieving learning goals. Be Inclusive ; maximize the ability of all learners to participate in and benefit from the learning experience. Community Principles - apply when short-format training is organized by communities (e.g., by science discipline, institution, or career stage) to achieve their objectives: Communities increase the impact of Short-format by working to... Reach : Take action to reach new types and larger audiences of learners. Scale : Take action to scale delivery of short-format training by new groups and larger numbers of instructors and instructional producers. Sustain : Take action to sustain the availability, usability,relevance, and reliability of learning materials and their supporting infrastructures.

Support integration of diagnostic assessment into SFT Summary: \ud83d\udd17 Assessment 1 promotes effective instruction in SFT and provides evidence that learning objectives are met by learners. Assessments (e.g., exercises, homework, quizzes) which take place during the learning process to facilitate instructor and learner diagnosis of the process of learning are formative or diagnostic. Assessment (e.g., final exams, lab practicals) at the end of an instructional unit, used to demonstrate that learning has been achieved, are summative. SFT generally lacks formal diagnostic assessment. The short duration of SFT may disincentivize the inclusion of diagnostic assessment, but SFT instructors may also lack training and experience in designing effective diagnostic assessments that are feasible for short time frames. For example, diagnostic assessment can be done before the course begins with data collected at time of course registration that helps us understand learning goals as well as lived and professional experiences of attendees. Diagnostic assessments are an accepted best practice for effective instruction, and instructors need to be supported in multiple ways to understand and leverage this practice. How might this work: \ud83d\udd17 Training has been developed to help SFT instructors understand the value of diagnostic assessment and how to integrate actionable assessments into their teaching. This training has been added to basic \u201chow to develop and deliver\u201d SFT , and implemented effectively and consistently to global volunteer instructors for years. Open resources (such as those that already exist from The Carpentries) for developing and utilizing diagnostic assessments can reduce instructor burden in designing their own, but instructors still need to learn about the importance and utility of diagnostic assessment, and some may need to learn how to deploy and interpret it. Examples of success include increasing numbers of instructors developing and including diagnostic assessment and documenting how results prompt them to adjust their teaching. Related Principles \ud83d\udd17 Effective Benefits to the learners \ud83d\udd17 Learners can learn to diagnose their strengths and weaknesses, assess their progress, target areas for improvement, and identify what they may need to learn next. Instructors who recognize the importance and utility of diagnostic assessment make learners true partners in learning. Learners are more engaged when they are actively participating through multiple diagnostic assessment tasks where performance is improving. Repeated diagnostic assessment can demonstrate objectively to learners that they actually changed from unable to able to solve a problem. Incentives to Implementers \ud83d\udd17 Training SFT instructors can encourage greater uptake of diagnostic assessment. Sharing existing resources for diagnostic assessment in the SFT context would reduce instructor implementation burden. Instructors have a better understanding of where instruction needs to be adjusted or supplemented. Instructors can have increased confidence that learners are achieving learning objectives. Barriers to Implementation \ud83d\udd17 The idea and deployment of diagnostic assessment may seem disruptive to SFT instructors and learners. Funding, evaluation expertise, and time will be needed to develop general resources for diagnostic assessment in SFT . Although much is already known about effective diagnostic assessment, SFT in life sciences is a diverse landscape. There is no \u201cone assessment fits all\u201d approach. Instructors will need support in finding balance between covering material in time available and integrating assessments. Training must also train instructors to adjust their instruction in response to assessment feedback. Effective diagnostic assessment depends to some extent on group size. This complicates the development, deployment, and use of diagnostic assessment by learners and instructors alike. Assessments should also be interesting for learners to use (e.g., incorporating culture or local context where possible). These are difficult to develop.

Assessment \ud83d\udd17 Measurement of learner knowledge, skills, attitudes, and beliefs, specifically in determining changes and gains that occur as a result of instruction. Assessment strategies can include formative (assessment during instruction - diagnostic) and summative (assessment at the conclusion of learning). Badge \ud83d\udd17 A digital credential that can be displayed (e.g., on a website, publication, course, etc.) which signifies an achievement or compliance with a standard by an individual or organization. Banbury Working Group \ud83d\udd17 Attendees at the 2021/22 virtual and in-person Banbury meetings (Making Career-spanning Learning in the Life Sciences Inclusive and Effective for All; December 2021, May 2022). Community (also disciplinary community) \ud83d\udd17 A group of people united by a feeling of fellowship as a result of sharing common attitudes, interests, and goals 4 . In our context, this often refers to scientific disciplinary communities which are linked to an area of study and related challenges. These communities work together to build knowledge and solutions. An individual can be a member of multiple communities at once. Community of Practice \ud83d\udd17 A group of people who come together around a common skill, interest, or discipline in order to learn from and support others as well as improve their abilities and skills. Communities of practice often include exchange of experience, ideas or resources, as well as collective building of knowledge and solutions to shared challenges or needs. Communities of practice may take on collaborative tasks together to move the field forward. Evaluation \ud83d\udd17 The formal process of determining the overall effectiveness of an educational program in achieving its objectives. Career-Spanning \ud83d\udd17 In our context, learning across all stages of a career. This can take the form of continued professional development and training after a terminal degree (e.g., BSc, MSc, PhD) and/or professional credentials. \u201cCareer spanning\u201d is not meant to reflect the age of the learner, but rather, their role(s) in their job or community over time. Catalytic Learning \ud83d\udd17 Catalytic learning is defined as learning that prepares the learner to continue/implement new knowledge and positions learners for future self-directed learning. Catalytic learning is a construct 3 that arises from a synthesis of long-standing, wide ranging bodies of literature on how adults learn/how learning happens. Specifically, catalytic learning is a function of metacognition, schema theory, and sustainable learning. This means that what is known about these core sources of knowledge can be leveraged to strengthen short format training (SFT), as well as any other adult learning context. Equity \ud83d\udd17 Equity is the fair and respectful treatment of all persons in a given environment. Equity in instruction involves the creation of accessible opportunities, as well as the reduction of disparities in opportunities and outcomes for diverse communities. Equity provides a framework upon which inclusion is built. Funders and Organizations \ud83d\udd17 Private, public, or governmental science funding agencies who support SFT with funding or infrastructure. Organizations - which also fund budgets for SFT - could include academic institutions, professional societies, or private corporations. Inclusion \ud83d\udd17 Inclusion is the result of creating an environment where everyone feels welcome, valued and respected, with equitable opportunity for participation. Inclusive (instruction) \ud83d\udd17 Instruction that creates a learning environment where everyone feels welcome, valued and respected, with equitable opportunity for participation. Infrastructure \ud83d\udd17 Resources that are organized to support SFT. These could be human infrastructures (e.g., communities of practice, trainers, specialists, program administrators), knowledge infrastructures (e.g., lesson content, assessment instruments), computational (e.g., internet, software, computer systems), or other systems. Instructors, Instructional Designers, and Instructional Support \ud83d\udd17 Instructors - An instructor is an individual who delivers SFT. Instructional designers - Those involved in planning and developing/adapting SFT to ensure content aligns with the goal and learning objectives. Instructional support - Those who recruit, train, and organize instructors, hosting or advertising for SFT, etc. Note : in some cases, individuals may fill one or more of these roles simultaneously. Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities \ud83d\udd17 Pedagogy \ud83d\udd17 The profession and art of teaching. Relevant for SFT, pedagogy can include special attention to features of adult (post-formal education), learners (andragogy), and student-centered and self-determined learning (heutagogy 2 ). Microcredential \ud83d\udd17 A competency-based credential certifying a pre-specified level of performance competency in a focused area of study. These can be considered \u201cmini-degrees\u201d and may or may not be associated with course credit. Self-directed learning \ud83d\udd17 Self-directed learning means the individual is in charge of planning what to learn, how to learn it, and how to assess their learning. This learning happens at the learner's own initiative as they seek out new opportunities to expand on what they\u2019ve learned. Short-format Training (SFT) \ud83d\udd17 Short-format training involves instruction in disciplinary skills and knowledge over a relatively short duration (i.e., hours, days, or a few weeks). Rather than specifying a set number of hours, the easiest way to identify SFT is that it will be labeled as a workshop, bootcamp, short-course, or similar term. SFT generally has the following features: Happens outside of a formal undergraduate, graduate, or other degree-granting program. Generally, SFT learners do not receive a summative grade or university course credits. SFT may also include post-degree training programs for professional accreditation (e.g., physicians or medical specialists training for fellowship exams in a specialty). Learners may be recognized as having earned \u201cprofessional development\u201d or \u201ccontinuing education\u201d credit. Content is determined by instructors or instructional designers, not necessarily by an institutional or professional society curriculum approval process (e.g., accreditation). Tends to be stand-alone, not requiring formal prerequisites or required subsequent SFT. There may be expectations for learner preparation or recommended prerequisite knowledge. SFT can be linked and can have prerequisites, but these characteristics are not enforced as they might be in a formal setting. Typically delivered to a group of learners who enroll because of their interest in the topic, rather than a mandate. Typically developed and delivered by domain experts outside of and separately from an institutional undergraduate/graduate coursework teaching role (if they have such a role). The extent to which a specific SFT course meets any of the above features will vary. Iwarsson, S., & St\u00e5hl, A.
