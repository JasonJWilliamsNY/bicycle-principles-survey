Each recommendation has a survey question to provide anonymous feedback. Visit the feedback forum to ask questions and start conversations. Join this low-traffic mailing list for updates. The need for a principle-based framework \ud83d\udeb2 Life science is rapidly increasing in interdisciplinarity, making career-spanning learning critical. New methods and deeper research questions require scientists and educators to traverse widening skill gaps to remain competent. STEM Careers and the Changing Skill Requirements of Work - Deming & Noray, NBER 2019 1 [O]ver time, new technologies replace the skills and tasks originally learned by older graduates, causing them to experience flatter wage growth and eventually exit the STEM workforce. Faster technological progress creates a greater sense of shortage, but it is the new STEM skills that are scarce, not the workers themselves. [S]ince technological progress erodes the value of these skills over time, the long-run payoff to STEM majors is likely much smaller than short-run comparisons suggest. More generally, the labor market impact of rapid technological change depends critically on the extent to which schooling and \u201clifelong learning\u201d can help build the skills of the next generation. Short-format training ( SFT ) \u2014 including workshops, bootcamps, and short courses \u2014 is a solution many turn to. However, the effectiveness of SFT is lower than many realize. Null effects of boot camps and short-format training for PhD students in life sciences - Feldon et.al., PNAS 2017 2 To increase the effectiveness of graduate research training, many universities have introduced boot camps and bridge programs lasting several days to several weeks. National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health currently support such interventions with nearly $28 million in active awards. Previous evidence for the efficacy of this format exists primarily in the form of anecdotes and end-of-course surveys. Here we show that participation in such short-format interventions is not associated with observable benefits related to skill development, scholarly productivity, or socialization into the academic community. Analyzing data from 294 PhD students in life sciences from 53 US institutions, we found no evidence of effectiveness across 115 variables. We conclude that boot camps and other short formats may not durably impact student outcomes. Overall, SFT is delivered without sufficient grounding in evidence-based pedagogy, and systemic inequity limits inclusion of all learners. The Bicycle Principles assemble education science and community experience into a framework for improving short-format training ( SFT ) through two cyclic (hence \"bi-cycle\") and iterative processes. The Bicycle Principles for short-format training \ud83d\udeb2 Core Principles \u2014 apply to all short-format training: All short-format training should... Use Best Evidence ; grounded in findings from the learning sciences and formally evaluated instruction. Promote Catalytic learning; prepare learners to succeed when the application of knowledge, skills, and abilities requires further self-directed study. Be Effective ; provide evidence (i.e., from assessment , evaluation ) to learners that they have made progress in achieving programmatic and learning goals. Be Inclusive ; maximize the ability of all learners to participate in and benefit from the learning experience. Community Principles \u2014 apply when short-format training is organized by communities (e.g., institutions, organizations, professional societies) to achieve their objectives: Communities increase the impact of short-format by working to... Reach : include new types and larger audiences of learners . Scale : increase delivery of short-format training by new groups and larger numbers of instructors and instructional developers . Sustain : work to maintain the availability, usability, relevance, and reliability of learning materials as well as supporting the supporting infrastructures, trainers, and communities which enable effective and inclusive training. The Principles and this website \ud83d\udeb2 Use The Principles as a roadmap to improved short-format training We believe improving short-format training enables learners to pursue the most impactful science and achieve their personal career goals. The Principles formalize effective practices and recognize the need for short-format training to be inclusive, equitable, and career-spanning. Applying The Principles to short-format training could accelerate scientific progress while broadening participation. Describe and prioritize recommendations that implement The Principles The Banbury Working Group (described below) developed an initial set of 14 recommendations that can be used to implement The Principles . Each recommendation describes benefits to learners, incentives for implementers, and barriers to implementation. An anonymous survey asks stakeholders to comment on and rate recommendations and their features. Promote community discussion and future implementation We hope to attract a diverse group of stakeholders with experience relevant to instruction (short-format and otherwise). Our efforts will draw on educational research, the experience and needs of the global community, as well as a diversity of disciplines, career stages, career paths, and cultural contexts. The feedback forum and mailing list are two additional ways we invite everyone to participate. We strive to include new groups in implementing, adapting, and adopting existing and future recommendations that support The Principles .

Professionalize the training of short-format training instructors and instructional designers Summary: \ud83d\udeb2 Creating a professional society(ies) or communities of practice dedicated to SFT could support instructors, instructional designers, and instructional supporters as well as helping to extend the reach of the Bicycle Principles . Instructors, instructional designers, and instructional administrators could benefit from the services provided by professional societies (e.g., a venue for self-identification, shared affiliation; dissemination of work; development of practice; rewarding of outstanding contributions). Instead of being a \u201cspecial interest group\" splintered from a specific professional society, this could be an independent, cross cutting, professional community. Such a group can promote appreciation for the professional competency of effective SFT instructors. It could also positively influence the entire scientific community by promoting effective and accessible training principles worldwide. Such a group could focus on training to assist SFT instructors and instructional designers to reach specific standards. Since most professional associations already have instruction-focused special interest groups, there is evidence many people would be interested. Furthermore, existing but unconnected groups around the world already have formal, iteratively-improving trainer-training programs in which new instructors engage. How might this work: \ud83d\udeb2 A SFT training professional society could be jointly established by organizations and/or projects that have significant SFT interest, expertise, and activity. As a community of practice, the society could: I) vet, curate, and/or maintain centralized resources ; II) work to clarify and address significant challenges, and; III) share innovations for the delivery of effective, inclusive, and career-spanning SFT . Like most professional societies there could be virtual and in-person convenings, topical or geographical sections, and various communication mechanisms. Participation in this community would support recognition of peers, and the strengthening and promotion of SFT teaching competencies. Success for this new professional society would look like a growing membership base and the co-production of actionable artifacts for others to reuse (e.g., recommendations, guidelines, methods). The unique mission of this society is its emphasis on improving the consistency and quality of SFT training, at the level of the individual instructor and instructional designers as a profession.

Centralize infrastructure for short-format training assessment and evaluation Summary: \ud83d\udeb2 Most short-format training instructors and instructional designers develop and maintain their own assessments and evaluation. Centralizing assessment and evaluation can reduce duplicated efforts while improving quality and allowing for flexibility to meet local needs. Learner assessment and program evaluation are important for effective instruction, but there are many barriers to implementing these in SFT . Centralizing infrastructure (i.e., human expertise, software, and technology) for SFT assessment and evaluation could promote consistency within and across programs and instructors. Centralization could also promote use of both formal assessment and evaluation, while reducing burden on individual instructors and instruction designers. This effort could include repositories of resources for assessment and evaluation design, online tools, question banks, help desks, etc., for use in SFT contexts. How might this work: \ud83d\udeb2 SFT instructors and instructional designers could use or contract with a centralized assessment and evaluation resource to help them determine their objectives and needs. Consultation would generate recommendations on resources (e.g., assessment activities or items, evaluation methods or instruments), highlighting their relevance and utility. Web services could also support long-term assessment, follow up, and evaluation. SFT participants could be directed to online tools to provide feedback using validated methods. Instructors would then receive actionable feedback reports to improve their teaching 1 and additional consultation if needed. Insights generated could also be used to report to funders. Currently organizations such as ELIXIR and Melbourne Genomics use standardized question sets for diagnostic assessment and to document program effectiveness and impact in reports for stakeholders 2 3 . Centralized evaluation projects such as NISER 4 have been used for undergraduate STEM evaluation. In the US, the National Institute for Learning Outcomes Assessment has also been successful at promoting learning outcomes assessment 5 . There is ample evidence that a strategy that formalizes and centralizes these services could work. Related Principles: \ud83d\udeb2 All Benefits to the learners: \ud83d\udeb2 The existence of independent, high-quality assessment and evaluation data on any given SFT will give learners confidence in the quality of the SFT . This could help learners choose between \u201ccompeting\u201d SFT options that have similar topic areas and objectives. As learners become familiar with high quality assessment and evaluation in their SFT options, they will be more likely to require these features, which will support broader adoption of this recommendation. If widely adopted, learners could have a consistent and familiar approach to rating and leaving feedback for SFT . This may also empower learners with the knowledge that their feedback can lead to changes. Incentives to implementers: \ud83d\udeb2 For Instructors and Instructional Designers Feedback from effective assessment and evaluation could provide objective and actionable information to improve both learning and instruction. Positive evaluation results from a trusted authority could increase enrollment and engagement. For Instructional Designers, Funders, and Organizations Expertise in assessment and evaluation is not typically available for SFT . A centralized resource can increase availability and consistency in both. Implementing assessment and evaluation at reduced time and cost. Collecting long-term learner feedback is a challenge for SFT , this resource could help. Evaluation data could be used for reporting to stakeholders and securing further funding. Barriers to implementation: \ud83d\udeb2 Creating, leading, resourcing, and sustaining a shared resource will take significant effort, time, energy, and expertise. Use of the resource will depend on interest by instructors, instructional designers, or organizations. Potentially, funding agencies or other funders may encourage the use of a centralized resource. Groups, organizations, or individuals may resist standardized assessments or evaluations as they might highlight current inadequacies. Funders\u2019 and organizations\u2019 encouragement of use of the centralized resource may be important to offset this worry.

Learner assessment and program evaluation are important for effective instruction, but there are many barriers to implementing these in SFT . Centralizing infrastructure (i.e., human expertise, software, and technology) for SFT assessment and evaluation could promote consistency within and across programs and instructors.

These limitations can make mandates equity, inclusion, and accessibility seem difficult or even \u201cunnecessary\u201d (i.e., \u201cyet another thing to comply with\u201d). Placing all responsibilities on individuals does not work. Without a collective and standardized framework, the application of policy or programs to support inclusive teaching, and/or accepting responsibility for ensuring this is part of teaching, could be uneven, unfair, or incorrect. Policies and practices are best implemented at a group level (e.g., organization, institution 1 ).

Assessment \ud83d\udeb2 Measurement of learner knowledge, skills, attitudes, and beliefs, specifically in determining changes and gains that occur because of instruction. Assessment strategies can include formative (assessment during instruction - diagnostic) and summative (assessment at the conclusion of learning). Badge \ud83d\udeb2 A digital credential that can be displayed (e.g., on a website, publication, course, etc.) which signifies an achievement or compliance with a standard by an individual or organization. Banbury Working Group \ud83d\udeb2 Attendees at the 2021/22 virtual and in-person Banbury meetings (Making Career-spanning Learning in the Life Sciences Inclusive and Effective for All; December 2021, May 2022). Community (also disciplinary community) \ud83d\udeb2 A group of people united by a feeling of fellowship as a result of sharing common attitudes, interests, and goals 4 . In our context, this often refers to scientific disciplinary communities which are linked to an area of study and related challenges. These communities work together to build knowledge and solutions. An individual can be a member of multiple communities at once. Community of Practice \ud83d\udeb2 A group of people who come together around a common skill, interest, or discipline to learn from and support others as well as improve their abilities and skills. Communities of practice often include exchange of experience, ideas or resources, as well as collective building of knowledge and solutions to shared challenges or needs. Communities of practice may take on collaborative tasks together to move the field forward. Evaluation \ud83d\udeb2 The formal process of determining the overall effectiveness of an educational program in achieving its objectives. Career-Spanning \ud83d\udeb2 In our context, learning across all stages of a career. This can take the form of continued professional development and training after a terminal degree (e.g., BSc, MSc, PhD) and/or professional credentials. \u201cCareer spanning\u201d is not meant to reflect the age of the learner, but rather, their role(s) in their job or community over time. Catalytic Learning \ud83d\udeb2 Catalytic learning is defined as learning that prepares the learner to continue/implement new knowledge and positions learners for future self-directed learning. Catalytic learning is a construct 3 that arises from a synthesis of long-standing, wide ranging bodies of literature on how adults learn/how learning happens. Specifically, catalytic learning is a function of metacognition, schema theory, and sustainable learning. This means that what is known about these core sources of knowledge can be leveraged to strengthen short format training ( SFT ), as well as any other adult learning context. Equity \ud83d\udeb2 Equity is the fair and respectful treatment of all persons in a given environment. Equity in instruction involves the creation of accessible opportunities, as well as the reduction of disparities in opportunities and outcomes for diverse communities. Equity provides a framework upon which inclusion is built. Funders and Organizations \ud83d\udeb2 Private, public, or governmental science funding agencies who support SFT with funding or infrastructure. Organizations - which also fund budgets for SFT - could include academic institutions, professional societies, or private corporations. Inclusion \ud83d\udeb2 Inclusion is the result of creating an environment where everyone feels welcome, valued and respected, with equitable opportunity for participation. Inclusive (instruction) \ud83d\udeb2 Instruction that creates a learning environment where everyone feels welcome, valued and respected, with equitable opportunity for participation. Infrastructure \ud83d\udeb2 Resources that are organized to support SFT . These could be human infrastructures (e.g., communities of practice, instructors, specialists, program administrators), knowledge infrastructures (e.g., lesson content, assessment instruments), computational (e.g., internet, software, computer systems), or other systems. Instructors, Instructional Designers, and Instructional Administrators \ud83d\udeb2 Instructors - An instructor is an individual who delivers SFT . Instructional designers - Those involved in planning and developing/adapting SFT to ensure content aligns with the goal and learning objectives. Instructional administrators - Those who recruit, train, and organize instructors, hosting or advertising for SFT , etc. Note : in some cases, individuals may fill one or more of these roles simultaneously. Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities \ud83d\udeb2 Knowledge is generally defined as factual material; for example, a surgeon knows what \u201ca suture\u201d is. They would also know what kinds of wounds need sutures (and what kind don\u2019t). This knowledge doesn\u2019t mean they are able to perform sutures successfully. Skills are defined as very specific and concretely observable or describable behaviors. For example, a surgeon could have the skills to execute a specific type of suture. This skill may exist without the individual knowing what type of wounds do/do not need sutures. Abilities are defined as skills sequenced together, usually as a result of the application of knowledge. For example, the ability to suture would be recognized in that surgeon who has the knowledge to recognize that a wound is of a type that needs suturing, the skills to perform the suture and to ensure that their suturing was done successfully (e.g., will be less likely to get infected/show a scar, etc.). Together, knowledge, skills, and abilities are abbreviated KSAs, and represent measurable outcomes of SFT , depending on the specific learning objectives of the SFT opportunity. The term \u201cKSAs\u201d is used in a general sense, whether the SFT opportunity specifically targets knowledge or skills or abilities or some combination. Pedagogy \ud83d\udeb2 The profession and art of teaching. Relevant for SFT , pedagogy can include special attention to features of adult (post-formal education), learners (andragogy), and student-centered and self-determined learning (heutagogy 2 ). Microcredential \ud83d\udeb2 A competency-based credential certifying a pre-specified level of performance competency in a focused area of study. These can be considered \u201cmini-degrees\u201d and may or may not be associated with course credit. Self-directed learning \ud83d\udeb2 Self-directed learning means the individual is in charge of planning what to learn, how to learn it, and how to assess their learning. This learning happens at the learner's own initiative as they seek out new opportunities to expand on what they\u2019ve learned. Short-format Training ( SFT ) \ud83d\udeb2 Short-format training involves instruction in disciplinary skills and knowledge over a relatively short duration (i.e., hours, days, or a few weeks). Rather than specifying a set number of hours, the easiest way to identify SFT is that it will be labeled as a workshop, bootcamp, short-course, or similar term. SFT generally has the following features: Happens outside of a formal undergraduate, graduate, or other degree-granting program. Generally, SFT learners do not receive a summative grade or university course credits. SFT may also include post-degree training programs for professional accreditation (e.g., physicians or medical specialists training for fellowship exams in a specialty). Learners may be recognized as having earned \u201cprofessional development\u201d or \u201ccontinuing education\u201d credit. Content is determined by instructors or instructional designers, not necessarily by an institutional or professional society curriculum approval process (e.g., accreditation). Tends to be stand-alone, not requiring formal prerequisites or required subsequent SFT . There may be expectations for learner preparation or recommended prerequisite knowledge. SFT can be linked and can have prerequisites, but these characteristics are not enforced as they might be in a formal setting. Typically delivered to a group of learners who enroll because of their interest in the topic, rather than a mandate. Typically developed and delivered by domain experts outside of and separately from an institutional undergraduate/graduate coursework teaching role (if they have such a role). The extent to which a specific SFT course meets any of the above features will vary. Expanded Principles Definitions \ud83d\udeb2 We provide expanded definitions for two of the core principles ( Catalytic , Inclusive ) and the community principles ( Reach , Scale , Sustain ). These principles had novel features ( Catalytic ) or points that had special emphasis with respect to short-format training ( Inclusive , Reach , Scale , Sustain ). Catalytic Learning (expanded) \ud83d\udeb2 Catalytic learning is a construct that arises from a synthesis of long-standing, wide ranging bodies of literature on how adults learn/how learning happens. Specifically, Catalytic learning is a function of four well-defined concepts in education research: metacognition, schema theory, transfer, and sustainable learning. This means that what is known about these core sources of knowledge can be leveraged to strengthen short format training, as well as any other adult learning context. Metacognition is the ability to think about, and regulate, one\u2019s thinking. For a learner, this means understanding where their knowledge is in need of updating and what kinds of learning strategies may be appropriate to solve a problem. Schemas are the mental models we use to organize information. A schema can exist for a process, like how a learner does science, or for knowledge like how to diagram a sentence. Schemas can be implicit, and unknown to the learner (i.e. the route you navigate when returning home), or they can be explicit (a protocol you follow to perform an experiment). Sustainable learning is learning that goes beyond the end of teaching. This is an essential idea in higher education as well as in any SFT design: learners should be able to continue learning more, or developing more sophistication about the knowledge, skills, and abilities that are the focus of any specific learning experience. There are four dimensions to sustainable learning: 1. Adding a new depth to learning; 2. Deconstruction, and then reconstruction or updating of existing knowledge; 3. Self regulation (self-direction and also self-assessment) in learning; and 4. Making conscious changes to learning behavior. Sustainable learning is critically dependent on metacognitive knowledge as well as metacognitive goal setting, monitoring, and evaluation. Transfer is how what is learned gets applied. Transfer can be categorized into two types: near transfer describes the application of what is learned to a problem or circumstance that is very similar to the setting or context where the knowledge, skill, or ability was learned (e.g., taking a code example to generate a bar graph and replacing the example data with your own). Far transfer is applying what has been learned to less related problems (e.g., using what was learned about generating the bar plot to generate a scatter plot). Most, if not all, adult education strives for far transfer, but this is historically one of the most elusive targets in education. Inclusion (expanded) \ud83d\udeb2 Inclusion means creating an environment where everyone feels welcome, valued and respected, with equal opportunity for equivalent participation. Put another way, inclusion means creating the conditions to have the opportunity to fully participate in an organization or, more specifically, a learning environment such as a short course. While inclusion may be conflated with the concept of diversity, these are two distinct, if related, ideas. Inclusion is, however, closely linked to the concept of equity. Equity is the fair and respectful treatment of all persons in a given environment and involves the creation of opportunities as well as the reduction of disparities in opportunities and outcomes for diverse communities. Equity provides a framework upon which inclusion is built. Of note, the terms \u201cequity\u201d and \u201cequality\u201d (treating everyone the same) are themselves often conflated with each other, but they are two distinct concepts: Equality speaks to \u201csameness\u201d, while \u201cequity\u201d speaks to fairness. Defining an inclusive environment is often done in the context of (some) marginalized or under-represented group(s). However, inclusion is meant to be a blanket concept that, ideally, applies to all persons or groups. Inclusion should create a sense of belonging for all participants in training so that everyone feels their perspective and learning are valued and important. In practice, particularly in the context of STEM research and training, \u201cinclusion\u201d and creating inclusive environments may not take the needs of all groups into consideration. In situations where design is not co-developed, persons with disabilities are often \u201cleft out\u201d of the inclusion conversation. Therefore, it is necessary to define one additional term: Accessibility. Accessibility is \u201can umbrella term for all aspects which influence a person\u2019s ability to function within an environment.\u201d 1 Put another way, accessibility is the design (and implementation!) of systems, policies, processes, ways of interacting with each other, and environments to ensure that persons with disabilities have equivalent access to a given space, and therefore equivalent experiences when participating in a given activity. Reach, Scale, Sustain (expanded) \ud83d\udeb2 Reach , Scale and Sustain are called community principles because they emerge and evolve at the level of groups of individuals. In particular, each of these three features focuses on the benefit of specific types of individuals involved in training: Reach aims at increasing the number, diversity, and improved experience of learners. Scale aims at increasing the number and supporting the work of instructors. Sustain aims at facilitating access and maintenance of the training materials, ultimately creating a training community (including learners and instructors, as well as staff of institutions funding and organizing training) around them. The provided definitions are valid in the context of the current document, although we recognize that the same terms have been used with different or interchangeable meaning in the literature; e.g. \u201csustainability\u201d used referring to building instructors capacity 5 . Understanding and addressing the problems of each group of individuals involved in training is essential to engage them all and achieve a good quality training experience for everyone involved in it. A deep understanding of the learning dynamics is demonstrated to be more important in facilitating learning than the course content itself 6 . We argue that when the interests of any of these groups are not met, the training is not effective or it cannot be supported in the long term, and both features are needed for career-spanning learning 7 . Learners\u2019 issues may start at the level of the course selection, in being aware of the training offer, in navigating it and in evaluating its quality. The significance of a training opportunity 8 is specific and it should be tailored to the training audience. During a course, learners\u2019 experience is influenced by the course format - e.g. specific educational design principles are applied to online learning 9 10 - as well as their own needs, preferences and motivation. Meeting the learners\u2019 values and expectations, adjusting to their feedback, designing activities for a diverse audience, are all practices that improve the course quality, learning experience and sharing 11 . The instructors\u2019 job is facilitated by the existence of a community around them. Peers can provide feedback, help during courses, and training materials to reuse or inspire. However, building these communities is not a responsibility of the instructors themselves 12 . A heterogeneous spectrum of entities might provide these communities: training institutes, consortia, projects, relevant societies and associations, professional accreditors, groups of volunteers, community managers, etc. These entities are responsible for encouraging and providing benefits for collaborative lesson development and delivery, or for actions that widen the initial scope/audience of a given lesson (the original format of a lesson may differ from the best way of scaling it) . In addition, they may design programs to train and certify new instructors and facilitate their communication 5 13 14 to ensure the scalability of training. These entities are interested in increasing the sustainability of training through training materials. This can be achieved by making training materials as Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) 15 as possible. However, it may be difficult to estimate how much effort, funding, and resources will be needed to do so, especially when the training is changing context or scale. In addition, ideally one would want to reach the widest possible audience, however this requires a well-planned and concentrated effort to be accessible and inclusive. Both institutions and funders involved in training may struggle in appreciating the benefit of such initiatives, as well as in elaborating long-term plans for sustaining training when the funding scheme is based on fixed-term short projects. Ideally, any training community should aim at identifying and tuning all the different interests involved, to encode them in the community practices and allow everyone to benefit from them at all stages of the community development.

Meeting the learners\u2019 values and expectations, adjusting to their feedback, designing activities for a diverse audience, are all practices that improve the course quality, learning experience and sharing 11 . The instructors\u2019 job is facilitated by the existence of a community around them. Peers can provide feedback, help during courses, and training materials to reuse or inspire. However, building these communities is not a responsibility of the instructors themselves 12 . A heterogeneous spectrum of entities might provide these communities: training institutes, consortia, projects, relevant societies and associations, professional accreditors, groups of volunteers, community managers, etc. These entities are responsible for encouraging and providing benefits for collaborative lesson development and delivery, or for actions that widen the initial scope/audience of a given lesson (the original format of a lesson may differ from the best way of scaling it) . In addition, they may design programs to train and certify new instructors and facilitate their communication 5 13 14 to ensure the scalability of training. These entities are interested in increasing the sustainability of training through training materials. This can be achieved by making training materials as Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) 15 as possible. However, it may be difficult to estimate how much effort, funding, and resources will be needed to do so, especially when the training is changing context or scale. In addition, ideally one would want to reach the widest possible audience, however this requires a well-planned and concentrated effort to be accessible and inclusive. Both institutions and funders involved in training may struggle in appreciating the benefit of such initiatives, as well as in elaborating long-term plans for sustaining training when the funding scheme is based on fixed-term short projects. Ideally, any training community should aim at identifying and tuning all the different interests involved, to encode them in the community practices and allow everyone to benefit from them at all stages of the community development.

Deploy short-format training to counter inequity Summary: \ud83d\udeb2 A comprehensive and well-resourced effort to use SFT to reduce systemic inequities by broadening participation of diverse scientists and supporting their research and career goals. This recommendation shifts SFT from a passive resource that is available to learners to an actively deployed tool to support scientists and promote increased scientific impact. Targeted SFTs have the potential to be transformative in giving researchers an opportunity to reskill, upskill, and redefine themselves to meet their scientific and career goals. Attention has been paid to improving undergraduate curriculum and graduate training to support students that have been historically excluded from the sciences. This effort should be extended to career-spanning SFT . The disparities and obstacles these historically-excluded scientists face do not end after achieving high levels of professional accreditation (e.g., PhD degree). For example, in the United States, graduates receiving PhDs from minority-serving institutions (which are generally under-resourced) are less likely to have academic positions than those who received their PhD from a majority-serving institution 1 . SFT can be used to empower researchers whose formal training did not include skills that have become critical to current research aims. All scientists could benefit when SFT is deployed as part of a long-term disciplinary strategy (i.e., STEM disciplines support continued professional development as a norm, such as in medicine), rather than only for the support of \u201cjust-in-time\u201d skills (i.e., workshops are developed for one-off specific needs without long-term planning for career-spanning needs). How might this work: \ud83d\udeb2 Professional societies, funders, and other interested stakeholders would have to assess the needs that must be met within a community. This includes assessment of instructional needs (e.g., which skills are most unmet for a stakeholder group), technical/infrastructural requirements to complete the training, and equity deficiencies (e.g., which stakeholders are currently excluded from full participation and why) for the community of learners. An example was a 2019 assessment in the field of bioinformatics and data science 2 . Based on the assessed needs, SFT opportunities would need to be deployed to specifically address the needs of learners. Evaluation would have to assess if the deployment is adequate in meeting learner needs and promoting equity. Related Principles: \ud83d\udeb2 Core : Inclusive Community : Reach Benefits to the learners: \ud83d\udeb2 Learners whose formal training lacked critical skills can be enabled to participate at the same level of research as learners who were prepared at more well-resourced institutions.

The relationship between SFT , unpaid labor, and free access for all should be explored to identify areas to increase equity for both learners and instructors, while also addressing issues of sustainability. SFT has a complex relationship between its value, accessibility, and costs of delivery. SFT delivered to learners for free increases its accessibility. However, free training may be undervalued and viewed as lower in quality. Conversely, when fees are required, some learners will be excluded if they or their institutions cannot or will not pay. Volunteer instructors must have career positions or financial ability to offer their time. Institutions must figure out how to sustain training programs beyond grant funding. These issues have been explored in other academic practices such as publication 1 2 and this work could be translated into the SFT context. Insights into the costs, trade-offs, and pay-offs could reveal ways to avoid amplifying structural inequities involved in SFT as commonly organized.

Develop an implementation strategy for Catalytic Learning Summary: \ud83d\udeb2 Instructors implementing a Catalytic learning approach explicitly prepare learners to learn on their own topics that can't be covered in the scope of a course, including topics that need updating over time. Catalytic learning is a new construct based on existing educational research. Although there is a strong evidence base for Catalytic learning 1 , a strategy for implementing and ensuring Catalytic learning in SFT is needed. Instructors will need training in applying Catalytic learning strategies, including guidelines to determine when it applies (i.e., career shifting vs \u201cjust-in-time\u201d training), and how to integrate the strategies effectively. Formalized assessment of resulting learning, and evaluation of instruction, will also need development. While Catalytic learning hasn\u2019t been deployed per se , all the literature around each of the sub-constructs of Catalytic learning are well supported suggesting this synthesis can be successful. How might this work: \ud83d\udeb2 Frequently, when learners attempt to implement what was covered in SFT , they realize they cannot apply that new knowledge, skill, or ability to the problems they need to solve. Instructors applying Catalytic learning principles in their training include specific strategies that help learners integrate new learning into their existing knowledge as well as successfully identify and fill in gaps. Learners will be empowered to clarify what self-directed learning they will need to expand and maintain their knowledge (e.g., self-study, additional training), guidance on how to identify learning opportunities that match their needs, and tools to self-assess their progress. A Catalytic learning focus in SFT instruction will result in an actionable post- SFT plan for learners to apply the SFT learning or continue additional learning. As learners become self-directed in a new topic, they may find it easier to participate in a new disciplinary community. Instructors will be able to ensure the SFT has a high likelihood of achieving the level of competency a learner needs to accomplish their task. Instructors and instructional designers can collaborate with education specialists (who can plan effective evaluation as well) to develop tools that prepare instructors and learners to share responsibility for learning.

For Funders and Organizations Learners are more likely to provide actionable feedback (from evaluation) about the impact of implementing Catalytic learning. Barriers to implementation: \ud83d\udeb2 Development of an implementation strategy will take energy, time, funding, and several types of expertise. The theoretical grounding of this approach is well-established, but knowledge translation has been lacking 2 .

A Catalytic learning focus in SFT instruction will result in an actionable post- SFT plan for learners to apply the SFT learning or continue additional learning. As learners become self-directed in a new topic, they may find it easier to participate in a new disciplinary community. Instructors will be able to ensure the SFT has a high likelihood of achieving the level of competency a learner needs to accomplish their task. Instructors and instructional designers can collaborate with education specialists (who can plan effective evaluation as well) to develop tools that prepare instructors and learners to share responsibility for learning.","title":"How might this work:"},{"location":"l_implement-catalytic/#related-principles","text":"Core : Catalytic , Effective","title":"Related Principles:"},{"location":"l_implement-catalytic/#benefits-to-the-learners","text":"A larger proportion of learners are better prepared to anticipate, and then work through, obstacles to implementing SFT learnings into professional practice.

Support integration of diagnostic assessment into short-format training Summary: \ud83d\udeb2 Short-format training is more effective when learners must demonstrate they understand course material during the instruction and instructors adjust their teaching to address misunderstandings. Assessment promotes effective instruction and provides evidence that learning objectives are met by learners. Assessments during the learning process (e.g., exercises, homework, quizzes) are formative or diagnostic, and help instructors and learners measure the progress of learning. Assessment at the end of an instructional unit (e.g., final exams, lab practicals) are summative and demonstrate that learning has been achieved. SFT generally lacks formal diagnostic assessment. The short duration of SFT may disincentivize the inclusion of diagnostic assessment, but SFT instructors may also lack training and experience in designing effective assessments that are feasible for short time frames. For example, assessment can be done in advance of the course with information from course registration that describes learner's goals and professional experiences. Polls and questions during instruction help learners and instructors gauge and correct understanding. Diagnostic assessments are an accepted best practice for effective instruction 1 , and instructors need to be supported in multiple ways to understand and leverage this practice. How might this work: \ud83d\udeb2 Training (such as developed by The Carpentries 2 and GOBLET 3 ) helps SFT instructors understand the value of diagnostic assessment and how to integrate actionable assessments into their teaching.

Open resources for developing and utilizing diagnostic assessments can reduce instructor burden in designing their own, but instructors and instructional designers still need to learn about the importance and utility of diagnostic assessment, and some may need to learn how to deploy, and interpret it.

Encourage evidence-based guidance to support career-spanning learning Summary: \ud83d\udeb2 Disciplinary communities should provide guidance for learning for learners across all stages of their career. self-directed learning is increasingly important for upskilling and post-formal-education training. As highly valued as it is, self-directed learning requires support at varying levels. In addition to learning how to use the evidence base to self-direct as a learner, self-directed learners may also need explicit guidance about what new knowledge, skills, and abilities they need. Disciplinary communities (primarily scientific professional societies, but also research groups/institutes, etc.) are positioned to understand the type and level of knowledge, skills, and abilities that are required to perform at the highest level of professional practice 1 . Professional societies can be encouraged to develop guidance that supports self-directed learning across the career span. How might this work: \ud83d\udeb2 Professional societies, and other disciplinary communities, can have a role in professional development. While these efforts are often focused primarily on students and early-career faculty, resources could be aimed to encourage self-directed, career-spanning learning. This would emphasize preparing learners with recommendations for skill building, especially as new methods appear or to counter persistent skill gaps. This also involves helping learners of all career stages, and possibly from other disciplines who seek to join new disciplinary communities, become self-directed learners within the discipline and beyond. For mid- and late-career stages, support could be directed to popularize and inform on new practices (e.g., open science, FAIR data principles 2 ), scientific innovations, etc. Support for formalized continuing professional development is common in many disciplines (e.g., engineering, law, and medicine); these professions require that practitioners remain current. Learners could be assisted in sifting through numerous learning opportunities to focus on what is most likely to be applicable to the problems they are working to solve. Given the role of professional organizations in the professionalization of the disciplines they represent, enabling and encouraging that currency among disciplinary practitioners is feasible and sensible. Related Principles: \ud83d\udeb2 Core : Catalytic , Inclusive Community : Reach , Sustain Benefits to the learners: \ud83d\udeb2 Learners are provided with clear recommendations on skills required for specific tasks, and tools to recognize what learning opportunities are most relevant to their objectives. Mid- and late-stage career learners are provided tools and opportunities for skill-building which helps them fulfill their roles as decision-makers (e.g., group leaders, advisors, reviewers) within the discipline. Learners from a wider range of backgrounds may feel empowered to complete courses recommended by the disciplinary community. Cultivating an expectation of continued professional development may open new paths for skill-building and updating throughout a career. Learners can competently participate in a new discipline. This can further diversify the pool of practitioners across scientific domains. Incentives to implementers: \ud83d\udeb2 For Instructors and Instructional Designers Instructors and instructional designers could design curriculum knowing what the priority topics are and needs of specific groups within a disciplinary community (e.g., early-career faculty, established investigators, peer reviewers). This would save the time and effort of doing their own needs analysis. For Funders and Organizations Professional societies and organizations offer SFT to promote knowledge exchange and to increase the level of professional competence. Promoting self-directed career-spanning learning will enhance these objectives. When SFT cannot be provided to fill a skill gap, or clear recommendations can help learners satisfy unmet needs. Vetted learning opportunities and/or guidance may increase the value and credibility of a professional society and earn the loyalty of members. As organizations monitor changes in a discipline\u2019s required skills, published guidelines for career-spanning learning can help the organization communicate priorities that organization intends to support. Barriers to implementation: \ud83d\udeb2 This guidance will take significant resources to create and maintain. Existing work to support self-direction can be leveraged.
