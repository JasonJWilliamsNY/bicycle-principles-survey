The Need for a Principle-based Framework Life science is rapidly increasing in interdisciplinarity, making career-spanning learning critical. New methods and deeper research questions requires scientists and educators to traverse widening skill gaps to remain competent. STEM Careers and the Changing Skill Requirements of Work - Deming & Noray, NBER 2019 1 [O]ver time, new technologies replace the skills and tasks originally learned by older graduates, causing them to experience flatter wage growth and eventually exit the STEM workforce. Faster technological progress creates a greater sense of shortage, but it is the new STEM skills that are scarce, not the workers themselves. [S]ince technological progress erodes the value of these skills over time, the long-run payoff to STEM majors is likely much smaller than short-run comparisons suggest. More generally, the labor market impact of rapid technological change depends critically on the extent to which schooling and \u201clifelong learning\u201d can help build the skills of the next generation. Short-format training (SFT) \u2014 including workshops, bootcamps, and short courses \u2014 is a solution many turn to. However, the effectiveness of SFT is lower than many realize. Null effects of boot camps and short-format training for PhD students in life sciences - Feldon et.al., PNAS 2017 2 To increase the effectiveness of graduate research training, many universities have introduced boot camps and bridge programs lasting several days to several weeks. National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health currently support such interventions with nearly $28 million in active awards. Previous evidence for the efficacy of this format exists primarily in the form of anecdotes and end-of-course surveys. Here we show that participation in such short-format interventions is not associated with observable benefits related to skill development, scholarly productivity, or socialization into the academic community. Analyzing data from 294 PhD students in life sciences from 53 US institutions, we found no evidence of effectiveness across 115 variables. We conclude that boot camps and other short formats may not durably impact student outcomes. Overall, SFT is delivered without sufficient grounding in evidence-based pedagogy, and systemic inequity limits inclusion of all learners. The Bicycle Principles assemble education science and community experience into a framework for improving short-format training (SFT) through two cyclic (hence \"bi-cycle\") and iterative processes. The Bicycle Principles for Short Format Training \ud83d\udd17 Core Principles - apply to all short-format training and are grounded in research and work in education, diversity, equity, and inclusion: All short-format training should... Use Best Evidence ; grounded in findings from the learning sciences and formally evaluated instruction. Promote Catalytic learning; prepare learners to succeed when the application of knowledge, skills, and abilities requires further self-directed study. Be Effective ; provide evidence (i.e., from assessment, evaluation) to learners that they have made progress in achieving programmatic and learning goals. Be Inclusive ; maximize the ability of all learners to participate in and benefit from the learning experience. Community Principles - apply when short-format training is organized by communities (e.g., by institutions, organizations, professional societies) to achieve their objectives: Communities increase the impact of short-format by working to... Reach : Take action to reach new types and larger audiences of learners . Scale : Take action to increase delivery of short-format training by new groups and larger numbers of instructors and instructional developers . Sustain : Take action to perpetuate the availability, usability, relevance, and reliability of learning materials as well as supporting the supporting infrastructures, trainers, and communities which enable effective and inclusive training. The Principles and this website \ud83d\udd17 Outline principles for improving short-format training We believe improving short-format training enables learners to pursue the most impactful science and achieve their personal career goals. The Principles formalize effective practices and recognize the need for short-format training to be inclusive, equitable, and career-spanning. Applying The Principles to short-format training could accelerate scientific progress while broadening participation. Describe and prioritize recommendations that implement The Principles The Banbury Working Group (described below) developed and initial set of 14 recommendations that could be used to implement The Principles . Each recommendation describes it benefits to learners, incentives for implementers, and barriers to implementation. An anonymous survey question allows stakeholders to comment on and rate recommendations and their features. Promote community discussion future implementation We hope to attract a diverse group of stakeholders with experience relevant to instruction (short-format and otherwise). Our efforts will draw on educational research, the experience and needs of the global community, as well as diversity of disciplines, career stages, career paths, and cultural contexts. The feedback forum and mailing list are are two ways we invite everyone to participate.

Support integration of diagnostic assessment into SFT Summary: \ud83d\udd17 Assessment 1 promotes effective instruction in SFT and provides evidence that learning objectives are met by learners. Assessments (e.g., exercises, homework, quizzes) which take place during the learning process to facilitate instructor and learner diagnosis of the process of learning are formative or diagnostic. Assessment (e.g., final exams, lab practicals) at the end of an instructional unit, used to demonstrate that learning has been achieved, are summative. SFT generally lacks formal diagnostic assessment. The short duration of SFT may disincentivize the inclusion of diagnostic assessment, but SFT instructors may also lack training and experience in designing effective diagnostic assessments that are feasible for short time frames. For example, diagnostic assessment can be done before the course begins with data collected at time of course registration that helps us understand learning goals as well as lived and professional experiences of attendees. Diagnostic assessments are an accepted best practice for effective instruction, and instructors need to be supported in multiple ways to understand and leverage this practice. How might this work: \ud83d\udd17 Training has been developed to help SFT instructors understand the value of diagnostic assessment and how to integrate actionable assessments into their teaching. This training has been added to basic \u201chow to develop and deliver\u201d SFT , and implemented effectively and consistently to global volunteer instructors for years. Open resources (such as those that already exist from The Carpentries) for developing and utilizing diagnostic assessments can reduce instructor burden in designing their own, but instructors still need to learn about the importance and utility of diagnostic assessment, and some may need to learn how to deploy and interpret it. Examples of success include increasing numbers of instructors developing and including diagnostic assessment and documenting how results prompt them to adjust their teaching. Related Principles \ud83d\udd17 Effective Benefits to the learners \ud83d\udd17 Learners can learn to diagnose their strengths and weaknesses, assess their progress, target areas for improvement, and identify what they may need to learn next. Instructors who recognize the importance and utility of diagnostic assessment make learners true partners in learning. Learners are more engaged when they are actively participating through multiple diagnostic assessment tasks where performance is improving. Repeated diagnostic assessment can demonstrate objectively to learners that they actually changed from unable to able to solve a problem. Incentives to Implementers \ud83d\udd17 Training SFT instructors can encourage greater uptake of diagnostic assessment. Sharing existing resources for diagnostic assessment in the SFT context would reduce instructor implementation burden. Instructors have a better understanding of where instruction needs to be adjusted or supplemented. Instructors can have increased confidence that learners are achieving learning objectives. Barriers to Implementation \ud83d\udd17 The idea and deployment of diagnostic assessment may seem disruptive to SFT instructors and learners. Funding, evaluation expertise, and time will be needed to develop general resources for diagnostic assessment in SFT . Although much is already known about effective diagnostic assessment, SFT in life sciences is a diverse landscape. There is no \u201cone assessment fits all\u201d approach. Instructors will need support in finding balance between covering material in time available and integrating assessments. Training must also train instructors to adjust their instruction in response to assessment feedback. Effective diagnostic assessment depends to some extent on group size. This complicates the development, deployment, and use of diagnostic assessment by learners and instructors alike. Assessments should also be interesting for learners to use (e.g., incorporating culture or local context where possible). These are difficult to develop.

Assessment \ud83d\udd17 Measurement of learner knowledge, skills, attitudes, and beliefs, specifically in determining changes and gains that occur as a result of instruction. Assessment strategies can include formative (assessment during instruction - diagnostic) and summative (assessment at the conclusion of learning). Badge \ud83d\udd17 A digital credential that can be displayed (e.g., on a website, publication, course, etc.) which signifies an achievement or compliance with a standard by an individual or organization. Banbury Working Group \ud83d\udd17 Attendees at the 2021/22 virtual and in-person Banbury meetings (Making Career-spanning Learning in the Life Sciences Inclusive and Effective for All; December 2021, May 2022). Community (also disciplinary community) \ud83d\udd17 A group of people united by a feeling of fellowship as a result of sharing common attitudes, interests, and goals 4 . In our context, this often refers to scientific disciplinary communities which are linked to an area of study and related challenges. These communities work together to build knowledge and solutions. An individual can be a member of multiple communities at once. Community of Practice \ud83d\udd17 A group of people who come together around a common skill, interest, or discipline in order to learn from and support others as well as improve their abilities and skills. Communities of practice often include exchange of experience, ideas or resources, as well as collective building of knowledge and solutions to shared challenges or needs. Communities of practice may take on collaborative tasks together to move the field forward. Evaluation \ud83d\udd17 The formal process of determining the overall effectiveness of an educational program in achieving its objectives. Career-Spanning \ud83d\udd17 In our context, learning across all stages of a career. This can take the form of continued professional development and training after a terminal degree (e.g., BSc, MSc, PhD) and/or professional credentials. \u201cCareer spanning\u201d is not meant to reflect the age of the learner, but rather, their role(s) in their job or community over time. Catalytic Learning \ud83d\udd17 Catalytic learning is defined as learning that prepares the learner to continue/implement new knowledge and positions learners for future self-directed learning. Catalytic learning is a construct 3 that arises from a synthesis of long-standing, wide ranging bodies of literature on how adults learn/how learning happens. Specifically, catalytic learning is a function of metacognition, schema theory, and sustainable learning. This means that what is known about these core sources of knowledge can be leveraged to strengthen short format training (SFT), as well as any other adult learning context. Equity \ud83d\udd17 Equity is the fair and respectful treatment of all persons in a given environment. Equity in instruction involves the creation of accessible opportunities, as well as the reduction of disparities in opportunities and outcomes for diverse communities. Equity provides a framework upon which inclusion is built. Funders and Organizations \ud83d\udd17 Private, public, or governmental science funding agencies who support SFT with funding or infrastructure. Organizations - which also fund budgets for SFT - could include academic institutions, professional societies, or private corporations. Inclusion \ud83d\udd17 Inclusion is the result of creating an environment where everyone feels welcome, valued and respected, with equitable opportunity for participation. Inclusive (instruction) \ud83d\udd17 Instruction that creates a learning environment where everyone feels welcome, valued and respected, with equitable opportunity for participation. Infrastructure \ud83d\udd17 Resources that are organized to support SFT. These could be human infrastructures (e.g., communities of practice, trainers, specialists, program administrators), knowledge infrastructures (e.g., lesson content, assessment instruments), computational (e.g., internet, software, computer systems), or other systems. Instructors, Instructional Designers, and Instructional Support \ud83d\udd17 Instructors - An instructor is an individual who delivers SFT. Instructional designers - Those involved in planning and developing/adapting SFT to ensure content aligns with the goal and learning objectives. Instructional support - Those who recruit, train, and organize instructors, hosting or advertising for SFT, etc. Note : in some cases, individuals may fill one or more of these roles simultaneously. Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities \ud83d\udd17 Pedagogy \ud83d\udd17 The profession and art of teaching. Relevant for SFT, pedagogy can include special attention to features of adult (post-formal education), learners (andragogy), and student-centered and self-determined learning (heutagogy 2 ). Microcredential \ud83d\udd17 A competency-based credential certifying a pre-specified level of performance competency in a focused area of study. These can be considered \u201cmini-degrees\u201d and may or may not be associated with course credit. Self-directed learning \ud83d\udd17 Self-directed learning means the individual is in charge of planning what to learn, how to learn it, and how to assess their learning. This learning happens at the learner's own initiative as they seek out new opportunities to expand on what they\u2019ve learned. Short-format Training (SFT) \ud83d\udd17 Short-format training involves instruction in disciplinary skills and knowledge over a relatively short duration (i.e., hours, days, or a few weeks). Rather than specifying a set number of hours, the easiest way to identify SFT is that it will be labeled as a workshop, bootcamp, short-course, or similar term. SFT generally has the following features: Happens outside of a formal undergraduate, graduate, or other degree-granting program. Generally, SFT learners do not receive a summative grade or university course credits. SFT may also include post-degree training programs for professional accreditation (e.g., physicians or medical specialists training for fellowship exams in a specialty). Learners may be recognized as having earned \u201cprofessional development\u201d or \u201ccontinuing education\u201d credit. Content is determined by instructors or instructional designers, not necessarily by an institutional or professional society curriculum approval process (e.g., accreditation). Tends to be stand-alone, not requiring formal prerequisites or required subsequent SFT. There may be expectations for learner preparation or recommended prerequisite knowledge. SFT can be linked and can have prerequisites, but these characteristics are not enforced as they might be in a formal setting. Typically delivered to a group of learners who enroll because of their interest in the topic, rather than a mandate. Typically developed and delivered by domain experts outside of and separately from an institutional undergraduate/graduate coursework teaching role (if they have such a role). The extent to which a specific SFT course meets any of the above features will vary. Expanded Principles Definitions \ud83d\udd17 We provide expanded definitions for two of the core principles ( Catalytic , Inclusive ) and the community principles ( Reach , Scale , Sustain ). These principles had novel features ( Catalytic ) or points that had special emphasis with respect to short-format training ( Inclusive , Reach , Scale , Sustain ). Catalytic Learning (expanded) \ud83d\udd17 Catalytic learning is a construct that arises from a synthesis of long-standing, wide ranging bodies of literature on how adults learn/how learning happens. Specifically, Catalytic learning is a function of four well-defined concepts in education research: metacognition, schema theory, transfer, and sustainable learning. This means that what is known about these core sources of knowledge can be leveraged to strengthen short format training, as well as any other adult learning context. Metacognition is the ability to think about, and regulate, one\u2019s thinking. For a learner, this means understanding where their knowledge is in need of updating and what kinds of learning strategies may be appropriate to solve a problem. Schemas are the mental models we use to organize information. A schema can exist for a process, like how a learner does science, or for knowledge like how to diagram a sentence. Schemas can be implicit, and unknown to the learner (i.e. the route you navigate when returning home), or they can be explicit (a protocol you follow to perform an experiment). Sustainable learning is learning that goes beyond the end of teaching. This is an essential idea in higher education as well as in any SFT design: learners should be able to continue learning more, or developing more sophistication about the knowledge, skills, and abilities that are the focus of any specific learning experience. There are four dimensions to sustainable learning: 1. Adding a new depth to learning; 2. Deconstruction, and then reconstruction or updating of existing knowledge; 3. Self regulation (self-direction and also self-assessment) in learning; and 4. Making conscious changes to learning behavior. Sustainable learning is critically dependent on metacognitive knowledge as well as metacognitive goal setting, monitoring, and evaluation. Transfer is how what is learned gets applied. Transfer can be categorized into two types: near transfer describes the application of what is learned to a problem or circumstance that is very similar to the setting or context where the knowledge, skill, or ability was learned (e.g., taking a code example to generate a bar graph and replacing the example data with your own). Far transfer is applying what has been learned to less related problems (e.g., using what was learned about generating the bar plot to generate a scatter plot). Most, if not all, adult education strives for far transfer, but this is historically one of the most elusive targets in education. Inclusion (expanded) \ud83d\udd17 Inclusion means creating an environment where everyone feels welcome, valued and respected, with equal opportunity for equivalent participation. Put another way, inclusion means creating the conditions to have the opportunity to fully participate in an organization or, more specifically, a learning environment such as a short course. While inclusion may be conflated with the concept of diversity, these are two distinct, if related, ideas. Inclusion is, however, closely linked to the concept of equity. Equity is the fair and respectful treatment of all persons in a given environment and involves the creation of opportunities as well as the reduction of disparities in opportunities and outcomes for diverse communities. Equity provides a framework upon which inclusion is built. Of note, the terms \u201cequity\u201d and \u201cequality\u201d (treating everyone the same) are themselves often conflated with each other, but they are two distinct concepts: Equality speaks to \u201csameness\u201d, while \u201cequity\u201d speaks to fairness. Defining an inclusive environment is often done in the context of (some) marginalized or under-represented group(s). However, inclusion is meant to be a blanket concept that, ideally, applies to all persons or groups. Inclusion should create a sense of belonging for all participants in training so that everyone feels their perspective and learning are valued and important. In practice, particularly in the context of STEM research and training, \u201cinclusion\u201d and creating inclusive environments may not take the needs of all groups into consideration. In situations where design is not co-developed, persons with disabilities are often \u201cleft out\u201d of the inclusion conversation. Therefore, it is necessary to define one additional term: Accessibility. Accessibility is \u201can umbrella term for all aspects which influence a person\u2019s ability to function within an environment.\u201d 1 Put another way, accessibility is the design (and implementation!) of systems, policies, processes, ways of interacting with each other, and environments to ensure that persons with disabilities have equivalent access to a given space, and therefore equivalent experiences when participating in a given activity. Reach, Scale, Sustain (expanded) \ud83d\udd17 Reach , Scale and Sustain are called community principles because they emerge and evolve at the level of groups of individuals. In particular, each of these three features focuses on the benefit of specific types of individuals involved in training: Reach aims at increasing the number, diversity, and improved experience of learners. Scale aims at increasing the number and supporting the work of trainers. Sustain aims at facilitating access and maintenance of the training materials, ultimately creating a training community (including learners and trainers, as well as staff of institutions funding and organizing training) around them. The provided definitions are valid in the context of the current document, although we recognize that the same terms have been used with different or interchangeable meaning in the literature; e.g. \u201csustainability\u201d used referring to building trainers capacity 5 . Understanding and addressing the problems of each group of individuals involved in training is essential to engage them all and achieve a good quality training experience for everyone involved in it. A deep understanding of the learning dynamics is demonstrated to be more important in facilitating learning than the course content itself 6 . We argue that when the interests of any of these groups are not met, the training is not effective or it cannot be supported in the long term, and both features are needed for career-spanning learning 7 . Learners\u2019 issues may start at the level of the course selection, in being aware of the training offer, in navigating it and in evaluating its quality. The significance of a training opportunity 8 is specific and it should be tailored to the training audience. During a course, learners\u2019 experience is influenced by the course format - e.g. specific educational design principles are applied to online learning 9 10 - as well as their own needs, preferences and motivation. Meeting the learners\u2019 values and expectations, adjusting to their feedback, designing activities for a diverse audience, are all practices that improve the course quality, learning experience and sharing 11 . The trainers\u2019 job is facilitated by the existence of a community around them. Peers can provide feedback, help during courses, and training materials to reuse or inspire. However, building these communities is not a responsibility of the trainers themselves 12 . A heterogeneous spectrum of entities might provide these communities: training institutes, consortia, projects, relevant societies and associations, professional accreditors, groups of volunteers, etc. These entities are responsible for encouraging and providing benefits for collaborative lesson development and delivery, or for actions that widen the initial scope/audience of a given lesson (the original format of a lesson may differ from the best way of scaling it) . In addition, they may design programs to train and certify new trainers and facilitate their communication 5 13 14 to ensure the scalability of training. These entities are interested in increasing the sustainability of training through training materials. This can be achieved by making training materials as Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) 15 as possible. However, it may be difficult to estimate how much effort, funding, and resources will be needed to do so, especially when the training is changing context or scale. In addition, ideally one would want to reach the widest possible audience, however this requires a well-planned and concentrated effort to be accessible and inclusive. Both institutions and funders involved in training may struggle in appreciating the benefit of such initiatives, as well as in elaborating long-term plans for sustaining training when the funding scheme is based on fixed-term short projects. Ideally, any training community should aim at identifying and tuning all the different interests involved, to encode them in the community practices and allow everyone to benefit from them at all stages of the community development.

Develop an implementation strategy for Catalytic Learning Summary: \ud83d\udd17 Instructors implementing a Catalytic learning approach explicitly prepare learners to learn on their own topics that can't be covered in the scope of a course, including topics that need updating over time. Catalytic learning is a new construct based on existing educational research. Although there is a strong evidence base for Catalytic learning 1 , a strategy for implementing and ensuring Catalytic learning in SFT is needed. Instructors will need training in applying Catalytic learning strategies, including guidelines to determine when it applies (i.e., career shifting vs \u201cjust-in-time\u201d training), and how to integrate the strategies effectively. Formalized assessment of resulting learning, and evaluation of instruction, will also need development. While Catalytic learning hasn\u2019t been deployed per se , all the literature around each of the sub-constructs of Catalytic learning are well-supported suggesting this synthesis can be successful. How might this work: \ud83d\udd17 Frequently, when learners attempt to implement what was covered in SFT , they realize they cannot apply that new knowledge, skill, or ability to professional practice and problems they need to solve. Instructors who utilize Catalytic learning principles in their training will better enable learners to apply what they learn by featuring specific strategies that help them ground what was covered in training into their own knowledge and successfully identify and fill in gaps. Instructors will be able to ensure the SFT has a high likelihood of achieving the level of competency a learner needs to accomplish their task. Instructors and instructional designers can collaborate with education specialists (who can plan effective evaluation as well) to develop tools that prepare instructors and learners to share responsibility for learning. Learners will be empowered to clarify what self-directed learning they will need to expand and maintain their knowledge (e.g., self-study, additional training), guidance on how to identify learning opportunities that match their needs, and tools to self-assess their progress. A Catalytic learning focus in SFT instruction will result in an actionable post- SFT plan for learners to apply the SFT learning, or continue additional learning.
