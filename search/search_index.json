The need for a principle-based framework Life science is rapidly increasing in interdisciplinarity, making career-spanning learning critical. New methods and deeper research questions requires scientists and educators to traverse widening skill gaps to remain competent. STEM Careers and the Changing Skill Requirements of Work - Deming & Noray, NBER 2019 1 [O]ver time, new technologies replace the skills and tasks originally learned by older graduates, causing them to experience flatter wage growth and eventually exit the STEM workforce. Faster technological progress creates a greater sense of shortage, but it is the new STEM skills that are scarce, not the workers themselves. [S]ince technological progress erodes the value of these skills over time, the long-run payoff to STEM majors is likely much smaller than short-run comparisons suggest. More generally, the labor market impact of rapid technological change depends critically on the extent to which schooling and \u201clifelong learning\u201d can help build the skills of the next generation. Short-format training ( SFT ) \u2014 including workshops, bootcamps, and short courses \u2014 is a solution many turn to. However, the effectiveness of SFT is lower than many realize. Null effects of boot camps and short-format training for PhD students in life sciences - Feldon et.al., PNAS 2017 2 To increase the effectiveness of graduate research training, many universities have introduced boot camps and bridge programs lasting several days to several weeks. National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health currently support such interventions with nearly $28 million in active awards. Previous evidence for the efficacy of this format exists primarily in the form of anecdotes and end-of-course surveys. Here we show that participation in such short-format interventions is not associated with observable benefits related to skill development, scholarly productivity, or socialization into the academic community. Analyzing data from 294 PhD students in life sciences from 53 US institutions, we found no evidence of effectiveness across 115 variables. We conclude that boot camps and other short formats may not durably impact student outcomes. Overall, SFT is delivered without sufficient grounding in evidence-based pedagogy, and systemic inequity limits inclusion of all learners. The Bicycle Principles assemble education science and community experience into a framework for improving short-format training ( SFT ) through two cyclic (hence \"bi-cycle\") and iterative processes. The Bicycle Principles for short-format training \ud83d\udeb2 Core Principles \u2014 apply to all short-format training and are grounded in research and work in education, diversity, equity, and inclusion: All short-format training should... Use Best Evidence ; grounded in findings from the learning sciences and formally evaluated instruction. Promote Catalytic learning; prepare learners to succeed when the application of knowledge, skills, and abilities requires further self-directed study. Be Effective ; provide evidence (i.e., from assessment, evaluation) to learners that they have made progress in achieving programmatic and learning goals. Be Inclusive ; maximize the ability of all learners to participate in and benefit from the learning experience. Community Principles \u2014 apply when short-format training is organized by communities (e.g., by institutions, organizations, professional societies) to achieve their objectives: Communities increase the impact of short-format by working to... Reach : include new types and larger audiences of learners . Scale : increase delivery of short-format training by new groups and larger numbers of instructors and instructional developers . Sustain : perpetuate the availability, usability, relevance, and reliability of learning materials as well as supporting the supporting infrastructures, trainers, and communities which enable effective and inclusive training. The Principles and this website \ud83d\udeb2 Use The Principles as a roadmap to improved short-format training We believe improving short-format training enables learners to pursue the most impactful science and achieve their personal career goals. The Principles formalize effective practices and recognize the need for short-format training to be inclusive, equitable, and career-spanning. Applying The Principles to short-format training could accelerate scientific progress while broadening participation. Describe and prioritize recommendations that implement The Principles The Banbury Working Group (described below) developed an initial set of 14 recommendations that can be used to implement The Principles . Each recommendation describes benefits to learners, incentives for implementers, and barriers to implementation. An anonymous survey asks stakeholders to comment on and rate recommendations and their features. Promote community discussion future implementation We hope to attract a diverse group of stakeholders with experience relevant to instruction (short-format and otherwise). Our efforts will draw on educational research, the experience and needs of the global community, as well as a diversity of disciplines, career stages, career paths, and cultural contexts.

Centralize infrastructure for SFT assessment and evaluation Summary: \ud83d\udeb2 Most short-format training instructors and instructional designers develop and maintain their own assessments and evaluation. Centralizing assessment and evaluation can reduce duplicated efforts while improving quality and allowing for flexibility to meet local needs. Learner assessment and program evaluation are important for effective instruction, but there are many barriers to implementing these in SFT . Centralizing infrastructure (i.e., human expertise, software, and technology) for SFT assessment and evaluation could promote consistency within and across programs and instructors. Centralization could also promote use of both formal assessment and evaluation, while reducing burden on individual instructors and instruction designers. This effort could include repositories of resources for assessment and evaluation design, online tools, question banks, help desks, etc., for use in SFT contexts. How might this work: \ud83d\udeb2 SFT instructors and instructional designers could use or contract with a centralized assessment and evaluation resource to help them determine their objectives and needs. Consultation would generate recommendations on resources (e.g., assessment activities or items, evaluation methods or instruments), highlighting their relevance and utility. Web services could also support long-term assessment, follow up, and evaluation. SFT participants could be directed to online tools to provide feedback using validated methods. Instructors would then receive actionable feedback reports to improve their teaching 1 and additional consultation if needed. Insights generated could also be used to report to funders. Currently organizations such as ELIXIR and Melbourne Genomics use standardized question sets for diagnostic assessment and to document program effectiveness and impact in reports for stakeholders 2 3 . Centralized evaluation projects such as NISER 4 have been used for undergraduate STEM evaluation. In the US, the National Institute for Learning Outcomes Assessment has also been successful at promoting learning outcomes assessment 5 . There is ample evidence that a strategy that formalizes and centralizes these services could work. Related Principles: \ud83d\udeb2 All Benefits to the learners: \ud83d\udeb2 The existence of independent, high-quality assessment and evaluation data on any given SFT will give learners confidence in the quality of the SFT . This could help learners choose between \u201ccompeting\u201d SFT options that have similar topic areas and objectives. As learners become familiar with high quality assessment and evaluation in their SFT options, they will be more likely to require these features, which will support broader adoption of this recommendation. If widely adopted, learners could have a consistent and familiar approach to rating and leaving feedback for SFT . This may also empower learners with the knowledge that their feedback can lead to changes. Incentives to implementers: \ud83d\udeb2 For Instructors and Instructional Designers Feedback from effective assessment and evaluation could provide objective and actionable information to improve both learning and instruction. Positive evaluation results from a trusted authority could increase enrollment and engagement.

Collecting long-term learner feedback is a challenge for SFT , this resource could help. Evaluation data could be used for reporting to stakeholders and securing further funding. Barriers to implementation: \ud83d\udeb2 Creating, leading, resourcing, and sustaining a shared resource will take significant effort, time, energy, and expertise. Use of the resource will depend on interest by instructors, instructional designers, or organizations. Potentially, funding agencies or other funders may encourage the use of a centralized resource. Groups, organizations, or individuals may resist standardized assessments or evaluations as they might highlight current inadequacies.

Assessment \ud83d\udeb2 Measurement of learner knowledge, skills, attitudes, and beliefs, specifically in determining changes and gains that occur as a result of instruction. Assessment strategies can include formative (assessment during instruction - diagnostic) and summative (assessment at the conclusion of learning). Badge \ud83d\udeb2 A digital credential that can be displayed (e.g., on a website, publication, course, etc.) which signifies an achievement or compliance with a standard by an individual or organization. Banbury Working Group \ud83d\udeb2 Attendees at the 2021/22 virtual and in-person Banbury meetings (Making Career-spanning Learning in the Life Sciences Inclusive and Effective for All; December 2021, May 2022). Community (also disciplinary community) \ud83d\udeb2 A group of people united by a feeling of fellowship as a result of sharing common attitudes, interests, and goals 4 . In our context, this often refers to scientific disciplinary communities which are linked to an area of study and related challenges. These communities work together to build knowledge and solutions. An individual can be a member of multiple communities at once. Community of Practice \ud83d\udeb2 A group of people who come together around a common skill, interest, or discipline in order to learn from and support others as well as improve their abilities and skills. Communities of practice often include exchange of experience, ideas or resources, as well as collective building of knowledge and solutions to shared challenges or needs. Communities of practice may take on collaborative tasks together to move the field forward. Evaluation \ud83d\udeb2 The formal process of determining the overall effectiveness of an educational program in achieving its objectives. Career-Spanning \ud83d\udeb2 In our context, learning across all stages of a career. This can take the form of continued professional development and training after a terminal degree (e.g., BSc, MSc, PhD) and/or professional credentials. \u201cCareer spanning\u201d is not meant to reflect the age of the learner, but rather, their role(s) in their job or community over time. Catalytic Learning \ud83d\udeb2 Catalytic learning is defined as learning that prepares the learner to continue/implement new knowledge and positions learners for future self-directed learning. Catalytic learning is a construct 3 that arises from a synthesis of long-standing, wide ranging bodies of literature on how adults learn/how learning happens. Specifically, catalytic learning is a function of metacognition, schema theory, and sustainable learning. This means that what is known about these core sources of knowledge can be leveraged to strengthen short format training ( SFT ), as well as any other adult learning context. Equity \ud83d\udeb2 Equity is the fair and respectful treatment of all persons in a given environment. Equity in instruction involves the creation of accessible opportunities, as well as the reduction of disparities in opportunities and outcomes for diverse communities. Equity provides a framework upon which inclusion is built. Funders and Organizations \ud83d\udeb2 Private, public, or governmental science funding agencies who support SFT with funding or infrastructure. Organizations - which also fund budgets for SFT - could include academic institutions, professional societies, or private corporations. Inclusion \ud83d\udeb2 Inclusion is the result of creating an environment where everyone feels welcome, valued and respected, with equitable opportunity for participation. Inclusive (instruction) \ud83d\udeb2 Instruction that creates a learning environment where everyone feels welcome, valued and respected, with equitable opportunity for participation. Infrastructure \ud83d\udeb2 Resources that are organized to support SFT . These could be human infrastructures (e.g., communities of practice, instructors, specialists, program administrators), knowledge infrastructures (e.g., lesson content, assessment instruments), computational (e.g., internet, software, computer systems), or other systems. Instructors, Instructional Designers, and Instructional Support \ud83d\udeb2 Instructors - An instructor is an individual who delivers SFT . Instructional designers - Those involved in planning and developing/adapting SFT to ensure content aligns with the goal and learning objectives. Instructional support - Those who recruit, train, and organize instructors, hosting or advertising for SFT , etc. Note : in some cases, individuals may fill one or more of these roles simultaneously. Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities \ud83d\udeb2 Knowledge is generally defined as factual material; for example, a surgeon knows what \u201ca suture\u201d is. They would also know what kinds of wounds need sutures (and what kind don\u2019t). This knowledge doesn\u2019t mean they are able to perform sutures successfully. Skills are defined as very specific and concretely observable or describable behaviors. For example, a surgeon could have the skills to execute a specific type of suture. This skill may exist without the individual knowing what type of wounds do/do not need sutures. Abilities are defined as skills sequenced together, usually as a result of the application of knowledge. For example, the ability to suture would be recognized in that surgeon who has the knowledge to recognize that a wound is of a type that needs suturing, the skills to perform the suture and to ensure that their suturing was done successfully (e.g., will be less likely to get infected/show a scar, etc). Together, knowledge, skills, and abilities are abbreviated KSAs, and represent measurable outcomes of SFT , depending on the specific learning objectives of the SFT opportunity. The term \u201cKSAs\u201d is used in a general sense, whether the SFT opportunity specifically targets knowledge or skills or abilities or some combination. Pedagogy \ud83d\udeb2 The profession and art of teaching. Relevant for SFT , pedagogy can include special attention to features of adult (post-formal education), learners (andragogy), and student-centered and self-determined learning (heutagogy 2 ). Microcredential \ud83d\udeb2 A competency-based credential certifying a pre-specified level of performance competency in a focused area of study. These can be considered \u201cmini-degrees\u201d and may or may not be associated with course credit. Self-directed learning \ud83d\udeb2 Self-directed learning means the individual is in charge of planning what to learn, how to learn it, and how to assess their learning. This learning happens at the learner's own initiative as they seek out new opportunities to expand on what they\u2019ve learned. Short-format Training ( SFT ) \ud83d\udeb2 Short-format training involves instruction in disciplinary skills and knowledge over a relatively short duration (i.e., hours, days, or a few weeks). Rather than specifying a set number of hours, the easiest way to identify SFT is that it will be labeled as a workshop, bootcamp, short-course, or similar term. SFT generally has the following features: Happens outside of a formal undergraduate, graduate, or other degree-granting program. Generally, SFT learners do not receive a summative grade or university course credits. SFT may also include post-degree training programs for professional accreditation (e.g., physicians or medical specialists training for fellowship exams in a specialty). Learners may be recognized as having earned \u201cprofessional development\u201d or \u201ccontinuing education\u201d credit. Content is determined by instructors or instructional designers, not necessarily by an institutional or professional society curriculum approval process (e.g., accreditation). Tends to be stand-alone, not requiring formal prerequisites or required subsequent SFT . There may be expectations for learner preparation or recommended prerequisite knowledge. SFT can be linked and can have prerequisites, but these characteristics are not enforced as they might be in a formal setting. Typically delivered to a group of learners who enroll because of their interest in the topic, rather than a mandate. Typically developed and delivered by domain experts outside of and separately from an institutional undergraduate/graduate coursework teaching role (if they have such a role). The extent to which a specific SFT course meets any of the above features will vary. Expanded Principles Definitions \ud83d\udeb2 We provide expanded definitions for two of the core principles ( Catalytic , Inclusive ) and the community principles ( Reach , Scale , Sustain ). These principles had novel features ( Catalytic ) or points that had special emphasis with respect to short-format training ( Inclusive , Reach , Scale , Sustain ). Catalytic Learning (expanded) \ud83d\udeb2 Catalytic learning is a construct that arises from a synthesis of long-standing, wide ranging bodies of literature on how adults learn/how learning happens. Specifically, Catalytic learning is a function of four well-defined concepts in education research: metacognition, schema theory, transfer, and sustainable learning. This means that what is known about these core sources of knowledge can be leveraged to strengthen short format training, as well as any other adult learning context. Metacognition is the ability to think about, and regulate, one\u2019s thinking. For a learner, this means understanding where their knowledge is in need of updating and what kinds of learning strategies may be appropriate to solve a problem. Schemas are the mental models we use to organize information. A schema can exist for a process, like how a learner does science, or for knowledge like how to diagram a sentence. Schemas can be implicit, and unknown to the learner (i.e. the route you navigate when returning home), or they can be explicit (a protocol you follow to perform an experiment). Sustainable learning is learning that goes beyond the end of teaching. This is an essential idea in higher education as well as in any SFT design: learners should be able to continue learning more, or developing more sophistication about the knowledge, skills, and abilities that are the focus of any specific learning experience. There are four dimensions to sustainable learning: 1. Adding a new depth to learning; 2. Deconstruction, and then reconstruction or updating of existing knowledge; 3. Self regulation (self-direction and also self-assessment) in learning; and 4. Making conscious changes to learning behavior. Sustainable learning is critically dependent on metacognitive knowledge as well as metacognitive goal setting, monitoring, and evaluation. Transfer is how what is learned gets applied. Transfer can be categorized into two types: near transfer describes the application of what is learned to a problem or circumstance that is very similar to the setting or context where the knowledge, skill, or ability was learned (e.g., taking a code example to generate a bar graph and replacing the example data with your own). Far transfer is applying what has been learned to less related problems (e.g., using what was learned about generating the bar plot to generate a scatter plot). Most, if not all, adult education strives for far transfer, but this is historically one of the most elusive targets in education. Inclusion (expanded) \ud83d\udeb2 Inclusion means creating an environment where everyone feels welcome, valued and respected, with equal opportunity for equivalent participation. Put another way, inclusion means creating the conditions to have the opportunity to fully participate in an organization or, more specifically, a learning environment such as a short course. While inclusion may be conflated with the concept of diversity, these are two distinct, if related, ideas. Inclusion is, however, closely linked to the concept of equity. Equity is the fair and respectful treatment of all persons in a given environment and involves the creation of opportunities as well as the reduction of disparities in opportunities and outcomes for diverse communities. Equity provides a framework upon which inclusion is built. Of note, the terms \u201cequity\u201d and \u201cequality\u201d (treating everyone the same) are themselves often conflated with each other, but they are two distinct concepts: Equality speaks to \u201csameness\u201d, while \u201cequity\u201d speaks to fairness. Defining an inclusive environment is often done in the context of (some) marginalized or under-represented group(s). However, inclusion is meant to be a blanket concept that, ideally, applies to all persons or groups. Inclusion should create a sense of belonging for all participants in training so that everyone feels their perspective and learning are valued and important. In practice, particularly in the context of STEM research and training, \u201cinclusion\u201d and creating inclusive environments may not take the needs of all groups into consideration. In situations where design is not co-developed, persons with disabilities are often \u201cleft out\u201d of the inclusion conversation. Therefore, it is necessary to define one additional term: Accessibility. Accessibility is \u201can umbrella term for all aspects which influence a person\u2019s ability to function within an environment.\u201d 1 Put another way, accessibility is the design (and implementation!) of systems, policies, processes, ways of interacting with each other, and environments to ensure that persons with disabilities have equivalent access to a given space, and therefore equivalent experiences when participating in a given activity. Reach, Scale, Sustain (expanded) \ud83d\udeb2 Reach , Scale and Sustain are called community principles because they emerge and evolve at the level of groups of individuals. In particular, each of these three features focuses on the benefit of specific types of individuals involved in training: Reach aims at increasing the number, diversity, and improved experience of learners. Scale aims at increasing the number and supporting the work of instructors. Sustain aims at facilitating access and maintenance of the training materials, ultimately creating a training community (including learners and instructors, as well as staff of institutions funding and organizing training) around them. The provided definitions are valid in the context of the current document, although we recognize that the same terms have been used with different or interchangeable meaning in the literature; e.g. \u201csustainability\u201d used referring to building instructors capacity 5 . Understanding and addressing the problems of each group of individuals involved in training is essential to engage them all and achieve a good quality training experience for everyone involved in it. A deep understanding of the learning dynamics is demonstrated to be more important in facilitating learning than the course content itself 6 . We argue that when the interests of any of these groups are not met, the training is not effective or it cannot be supported in the long term, and both features are needed for career-spanning learning 7 . Learners\u2019 issues may start at the level of the course selection, in being aware of the training offer, in navigating it and in evaluating its quality. The significance of a training opportunity 8 is specific and it should be tailored to the training audience. During a course, learners\u2019 experience is influenced by the course format - e.g. specific educational design principles are applied to online learning 9 10 - as well as their own needs, preferences and motivation. Meeting the learners\u2019 values and expectations, adjusting to their feedback, designing activities for a diverse audience, are all practices that improve the course quality, learning experience and sharing 11 . The instructors\u2019 job is facilitated by the existence of a community around them. Peers can provide feedback, help during courses, and training materials to reuse or inspire. However, building these communities is not a responsibility of the instructors themselves 12 . A heterogeneous spectrum of entities might provide these communities: training institutes, consortia, projects, relevant societies and associations, professional accreditors, groups of volunteers, etc. These entities are responsible for encouraging and providing benefits for collaborative lesson development and delivery, or for actions that widen the initial scope/audience of a given lesson (the original format of a lesson may differ from the best way of scaling it) . In addition, they may design programs to train and certify new instructors and facilitate their communication 5 13 14 to ensure the scalability of training. These entities are interested in increasing the sustainability of training through training materials. This can be achieved by making training materials as Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) 15 as possible. However, it may be difficult to estimate how much effort, funding, and resources will be needed to do so, especially when the training is changing context or scale. In addition, ideally one would want to reach the widest possible audience, however this requires a well-planned and concentrated effort to be accessible and inclusive. Both institutions and funders involved in training may struggle in appreciating the benefit of such initiatives, as well as in elaborating long-term plans for sustaining training when the funding scheme is based on fixed-term short projects. Ideally, any training community should aim at identifying and tuning all the different interests involved, to encode them in the community practices and allow everyone to benefit from them at all stages of the community development.

Schemas can be implicit, and unknown to the learner (i.e. the route you navigate when returning home), or they can be explicit (a protocol you follow to perform an experiment). Sustainable learning is learning that goes beyond the end of teaching. This is an essential idea in higher education as well as in any SFT design: learners should be able to continue learning more, or developing more sophistication about the knowledge, skills, and abilities that are the focus of any specific learning experience. There are four dimensions to sustainable learning: 1. Adding a new depth to learning; 2. Deconstruction, and then reconstruction or updating of existing knowledge; 3. Self regulation (self-direction and also self-assessment) in learning; and 4. Making conscious changes to learning behavior. Sustainable learning is critically dependent on metacognitive knowledge as well as metacognitive goal setting, monitoring, and evaluation. Transfer is how what is learned gets applied. Transfer can be categorized into two types: near transfer describes the application of what is learned to a problem or circumstance that is very similar to the setting or context where the knowledge, skill, or ability was learned (e.g., taking a code example to generate a bar graph and replacing the example data with your own). Far transfer is applying what has been learned to less related problems (e.g., using what was learned about generating the bar plot to generate a scatter plot). Most, if not all, adult education strives for far transfer, but this is historically one of the most elusive targets in education.","title":"Catalytic Learning (expanded)"},{"location":"definitions/#inclusion-expanded","text":"Inclusion means creating an environment where everyone feels welcome, valued and respected, with equal opportunity for equivalent participation. Put another way, inclusion means creating the conditions to have the opportunity to fully participate in an organization or, more specifically, a learning environment such as a short course. While inclusion may be conflated with the concept of diversity, these are two distinct, if related, ideas. Inclusion is, however, closely linked to the concept of equity. Equity is the fair and respectful treatment of all persons in a given environment and involves the creation of opportunities as well as the reduction of disparities in opportunities and outcomes for diverse communities. Equity provides a framework upon which inclusion is built. Of note, the terms \u201cequity\u201d and \u201cequality\u201d (treating everyone the same) are themselves often conflated with each other, but they are two distinct concepts: Equality speaks to \u201csameness\u201d, while \u201cequity\u201d speaks to fairness. Defining an inclusive environment is often done in the context of (some) marginalized or under-represented group(s). However, inclusion is meant to be a blanket concept that, ideally, applies to all persons or groups. Inclusion should create a sense of belonging for all participants in training so that everyone feels their perspective and learning are valued and important. In practice, particularly in the context of STEM research and training, \u201cinclusion\u201d and creating inclusive environments may not take the needs of all groups into consideration. In situations where design is not co-developed, persons with disabilities are often \u201cleft out\u201d of the inclusion conversation. Therefore, it is necessary to define one additional term: Accessibility. Accessibility is \u201can umbrella term for all aspects which influence a person\u2019s ability to function within an environment.\u201d 1 Put another way, accessibility is the design (and implementation!) of systems, policies, processes, ways of interacting with each other, and environments to ensure that persons with disabilities have equivalent access to a given space, and therefore equivalent experiences when participating in a given activity.","title":"Inclusion (expanded)"},{"location":"definitions/#reach-scale-sustain-expanded","text":"Reach , Scale and Sustain are called community principles because they emerge and evolve at the level of groups of individuals. In particular, each of these three features focuses on the benefit of specific types of individuals involved in training: Reach aims at increasing the number, diversity, and improved experience of learners. Scale aims at increasing the number and supporting the work of instructors. Sustain aims at facilitating access and maintenance of the training materials, ultimately creating a training community (including learners and instructors, as well as staff of institutions funding and organizing training) around them. The provided definitions are valid in the context of the current document, although we recognize that the same terms have been used with different or interchangeable meaning in the literature; e.g. \u201csustainability\u201d used referring to building instructors capacity 5 . Understanding and addressing the problems of each group of individuals involved in training is essential to engage them all and achieve a good quality training experience for everyone involved in it. A deep understanding of the learning dynamics is demonstrated to be more important in facilitating learning than the course content itself 6 . We argue that when the interests of any of these groups are not met, the training is not effective or it cannot be supported in the long term, and both features are needed for career-spanning learning 7 . Learners\u2019 issues may start at the level of the course selection, in being aware of the training offer, in navigating it and in evaluating its quality. The significance of a training opportunity 8 is specific and it should be tailored to the training audience. During a course, learners\u2019 experience is influenced by the course format - e.g. specific educational design principles are applied to online learning 9 10 - as well as their own needs, preferences and motivation. Meeting the learners\u2019 values and expectations, adjusting to their feedback, designing activities for a diverse audience, are all practices that improve the course quality, learning experience and sharing 11 . The instructors\u2019 job is facilitated by the existence of a community around them. Peers can provide feedback, help during courses, and training materials to reuse or inspire. However, building these communities is not a responsibility of the instructors themselves 12 . A heterogeneous spectrum of entities might provide these communities: training institutes, consortia, projects, relevant societies and associations, professional accreditors, groups of volunteers, etc. These entities are responsible for encouraging and providing benefits for collaborative lesson development and delivery, or for actions that widen the initial scope/audience of a given lesson (the original format of a lesson may differ from the best way of scaling it) . In addition, they may design programs to train and certify new instructors and facilitate their communication 5 13 14 to ensure the scalability of training. These entities are interested in increasing the sustainability of training through training materials. This can be achieved by making training materials as Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) 15 as possible. However, it may be difficult to estimate how much effort, funding, and resources will be needed to do so, especially when the training is changing context or scale. In addition, ideally one would want to reach the widest possible audience, however this requires a well-planned and concentrated effort to be accessible and inclusive. Both institutions and funders involved in training may struggle in appreciating the benefit of such initiatives, as well as in elaborating long-term plans for sustaining training when the funding scheme is based on fixed-term short projects. Ideally, any training community should aim at identifying and tuning all the different interests involved, to encode them in the community practices and allow everyone to benefit from them at all stages of the community development.

Operationalize equitable and inclusive practice in SFT as an ethical obligation Summary: \ud83d\udeb2 SSFT instructors and instructional designers need to recognize inclusivity and equity as an ethical obligation. Acting on this obligation requires appropriately resourcing implementers, reducing their barriers, and countering structural inequities . We know that without institutional commitment and support, inclusion will be inconsistent or lacking in SFT 1 2 . The short timeframe and relatively limited engagement between instructors and learners in SFTs limits opportunities to understand needs, expertise, and context. Making inclusion and equity of individual instructors can make equity, inclusion, and accessibility seem difficult or even \u201cunnecessary\u201d (i.e. \u201cyet another thing to comply with.\u201d Without a collective and standardized framework, the application of policy or programs to support inclusive teaching, and/or accepting responsibility for ensuring this is part of teaching, could be uneven, unfair, or incorrect. Policies and practices are best implemented at a group level (e.g., organization, institution 1 ). This facilitates integration of inclusive and equitable teaching throughout all SFT from within an organization. Engagement by individual instructors across organizations could be facilitated by within-institution commitments that are shared with the wider community. Communities of practice may emerge from the efforts of individuals working within institutions or organizations with a coherent program who then encourage and engage with individuals without that institutional support 3 . How might this work: \ud83d\udeb2 Funding agencies, government organizations, as well as grassroots stakeholders (i.e. instructors, learners) could collaborate on sets of guidelines for equitable and inclusive practice in SFT . A commitment to engaging with those practices should be facilitated by concrete and actionable guidelines 4 . The ecosystem of accessibility and inclusion expertise is often separate from subject matter and organizational expertise within the SFT space, although there are a few groups and professionals who are both accessibility and inclusion experts in STEM disciplines. Creating an accessibility services framework, guidelines, and instructor training resources for SFTs - akin to that which exists in Post Secondary Education (PSE) in the US and Canada - could support this operationalization. Mechanisms for ongoing feedback and evaluation related to accessibility and inclusion must also be developed for SFT ; accountability is necessary to support claims of the use of guidelines. This includes evaluation prior to the start of the course, during the course, and at the end. This also includes evaluation of both programs and individual courses or modules. Long-term positive impacts of policies and practices on inclusion and accessibility have been reported in educational and workplace settings. Policies are not perfect, but they do drive long-term change. Ultimately, learners could expect a \u201cstandard of equitable and inclusive training\u201d in SFT that is at least as good as what is usually legally guaranteed in formal instructional settings. Related Principles: \ud83d\udeb2 Core : Inclusive Community : Reach Benefits to the learners: \ud83d\udeb2 Learning materials, instructional formats and settings would become accessible and inclusive. Instructors who articulate and follow through on a commitment to equitable and inclusive teaching would be easier to distinguish. Instructors who effectively utilize accessibility and inclusion practices can reduce burdens on learners, and increase the chances of success of the SFT in meeting learning objectives. A wider range of learners (i.e., from historically excluded groups) would enjoy fuller participation. Incentives to implementers: \ud83d\udeb2 For Instructors and Instructional Designers Shared standards and strategies would save time and increase confidence by using vetted approaches. This would also improve learner experience by creating a more uniform experience with fewer unknowns in how equity and inclusion will be approached. For Instructional Designers, Funders, and Organizations Wider range in attendees, applicants, and fuller participation from groups that are under-represented today. This includes engaging and retaining new scientists -who are currently being lost when instruction fails to recognize/engage or accommodate them -and empowering them to do their best work. SFT that follows these practices will better meet the broadening participation objectives of funders as well as meet their own goals to promote equity and inclusion. Barriers to implementation: \ud83d\udeb2 An adequately funded, appropriately resourced, and diverse group would have to develop a set of guidelines. Additional groups would need to be supported in adapting and adopting the guidelines to be appropriate for various contexts and cultures (e.g., incorporating community-developed principles 5 in instruction). Collaborations with disability and inclusion experts in higher education and professional development ( SFT ) will be needed and that expertise may be in demand. Training on inclusive practices may be required for the instructor and instructional designers/support staff to ensure that courses all reflect the standards and policies, and that Instructors all know how to implement them. Changes will be needed at the individual and at multiple organizational levels, to ensure equity and inclusion are seen as ethical obligations rather than \u201cnice to have\u201d features of SFT 6 .

Operationalize equitable and inclusive practice in SFT as an ethical obligation"},{"location":"equity-inclusion-ethics/#summary","text":"SSFT instructors and instructional designers need to recognize inclusivity and equity as an ethical obligation. Acting on this obligation requires appropriately resourcing implementers, reducing their barriers, and countering structural inequities . We know that without institutional commitment and support, inclusion will be inconsistent or lacking in SFT 1 2 . The short timeframe and relatively limited engagement between instructors and learners in SFTs limits opportunities to understand needs, expertise, and context. Making inclusion and equity of individual instructors can make equity, inclusion, and accessibility seem difficult or even \u201cunnecessary\u201d (i.e. \u201cyet another thing to comply with.\u201d Without a collective and standardized framework, the application of policy or programs to support inclusive teaching, and/or accepting responsibility for ensuring this is part of teaching, could be uneven, unfair, or incorrect. Policies and practices are best implemented at a group level (e.g., organization, institution 1 ). This facilitates integration of inclusive and equitable teaching throughout all SFT from within an organization. Engagement by individual instructors across organizations could be facilitated by within-institution commitments that are shared with the wider community. Communities of practice may emerge from the efforts of individuals working within institutions or organizations with a coherent program who then encourage and engage with individuals without that institutional support 3 .","title":"Summary:"},{"location":"equity-inclusion-ethics/#how-might-this-work","text":"Funding agencies, government organizations, as well as grassroots stakeholders (i.e. instructors, learners) could collaborate on sets of guidelines for equitable and inclusive practice in SFT . A commitment to engaging with those practices should be facilitated by concrete and actionable guidelines 4 . The ecosystem of accessibility and inclusion expertise is often separate from subject matter and organizational expertise within the SFT space, although there are a few groups and professionals who are both accessibility and inclusion experts in STEM disciplines. Creating an accessibility services framework, guidelines, and instructor training resources for SFTs - akin to that which exists in Post Secondary Education (PSE) in the US and Canada - could support this operationalization. Mechanisms for ongoing feedback and evaluation related to accessibility and inclusion must also be developed for SFT ; accountability is necessary to support claims of the use of guidelines. This includes evaluation prior to the start of the course, during the course, and at the end. This also includes evaluation of both programs and individual courses or modules. Long-term positive impacts of policies and practices on inclusion and accessibility have been reported in educational and workplace settings. Policies are not perfect, but they do drive long-term change. Ultimately, learners could expect a \u201cstandard of equitable and inclusive training\u201d in SFT that is at least as good as what is usually legally guaranteed in formal instructional settings.","title":"How might this work:"},{"location":"equity-inclusion-ethics/#related-principles","text":"Core : Inclusive Community : Reach","title":"Related Principles:"},{"location":"equity-inclusion-ethics/#benefits-to-the-learners","text":"Learning materials, instructional formats and settings would become accessible and inclusive.

A wider range of learners (i.e., from historically excluded groups) would enjoy fuller participation.","title":"Benefits to the learners:"},{"location":"equity-inclusion-ethics/#incentives-to-implementers","text":"For Instructors and Instructional Designers Shared standards and strategies would save time and increase confidence by using vetted approaches. This would also improve learner experience by creating a more uniform experience with fewer unknowns in how equity and inclusion will be approached. For Instructional Designers, Funders, and Organizations Wider range in attendees, applicants, and fuller participation from groups that are under-represented today. This includes engaging and retaining new scientists -who are currently being lost when instruction fails to recognize/engage or accommodate them -and empowering them to do their best work. SFT that follows these practices will better meet the broadening participation objectives of funders as well as meet their own goals to promote equity and inclusion.","title":"Incentives to implementers:"},{"location":"equity-inclusion-ethics/#barriers-to-implementation","text":"An adequately funded, appropriately resourced, and diverse group would have to develop a set of guidelines. Additional groups would need to be supported in adapting and adopting the guidelines to be appropriate for various contexts and cultures (e.g., incorporating community-developed principles 5 in instruction). Collaborations with disability and inclusion experts in higher education and professional development ( SFT ) will be needed and that expertise may be in demand. Training on inclusive practices may be required for the instructor and instructional designers/support staff to ensure that courses all reflect the standards and policies, and that Instructors all know how to implement them.

Professionalize the training of SFT instructors and instructional producers Summary: \ud83d\udeb2 Creating a professional society(ies) or communities of practice dedicated to SFT could support instructors, instructional designers, and instructional supporters as well as helping to extend the reach of the Bicycle Principles . Instructors, instructional designers, and instructional supporters could benefit from the services provided by professional societies (e.g., a venue for self-identification, shared affiliation; dissemination of work; development of practice; rewarding of outstanding contributions). Instead of being a \u201cspecial interest group\" splintered from a specific professional society, this could be an independent, cross cutting, professional community. Such a group can promote greater appreciation for the complexity and appreciation for professional competency of effective SFT instructors. It could also positively influence the entire scientific community by promoting effective and accessible training principles worldwide. A primary function of this group would be to provide training to assist SFT instructors and instructional designers to reach specific standards. Since most professional associations already have instruction-focused special interest groups, there is evidence many people would be interested. Furthermore, existing but unconnected groups around the world already have formal, iteratively-improving, trainer-training programs in which new instructors engage. How might this work: \ud83d\udeb2 A SFT training professional society could be jointly established by organizations and/or projects that have significant SFT interest, expertise, and activity. As a community of practice, the society could: I) vet, curate, and/or maintain centralized resources ; II) work to clarify and address significant challenges, and; III) share innovations for the delivery of effective, inclusive, and career-spanning SFT . Like most professional societies there could be virtual and in-person convenings, topical or geographical sections, and various communication mechanisms. Participation in this community would support recognition of peers, and the strengthening and promotion of SFT teaching competencies. Success for this new professional society would look like a growing membership base and the co-production of actionable artifacts for others to reuse (e.g., recommendations, guidelines, methods). The unique mission of this society is its emphasis on improving the consistency and quality of SFT training, at the level of the individual instructor and instructors as a profession. Individuals from diverse scientific disciplines could join this society to signal their commitment to effective, inclusive SFT instruction. Related Principles: \ud83d\udeb2 All Benefits to the learners: \ud83d\udeb2 Increases the likelihood of successful SFT learning experiences when instructors have benefited from training and knowledge exchange promoted by the SFT professional society. More high-quality instructors trained by the society increase the chance of meeting learner demand for SFT . Incentives to implementers: \ud83d\udeb2 For Instructors Recognition of their role and its importance in the scientific community, peer support, and increased sense of community. Professionalization may counter the perception that SFT (which is often delivered at no cost to learners) is not of \u201creal value\u201d. For Instructors, Instructional Designers, Instructional Supporters Collective impact could help disseminate effective practices and enhance the adoption of practices that individual instructors or SFT programs might have difficulty in implementing alone. Opportunities to develop new, better, and sustainable, economic models for SFT as well as models for applying community Bicycle Principles (i.e., Reach , Scale , Sustain ). For Funders and Organizations Working with an SFT professional society may strengthen justifications for SFT funding and allow funders to interact with multiple programs through a single group. The professionalization of instructors brings value to SFT provided by organizations. Barriers to implementation: \ud83d\udeb2 There must be enough global grassroots support to form such an organization, and this requires clear value propositions for members and financial sponsors 4 . There are legal, logistical, and financial barriers to launching an entirely new organization. It may be possible for existing organizations and nonprofits to help builders leverage existing resources and groups. To be successful, this organization will have to demonstrate significant and positive effects on the community of instructors and instruction developers. Many of these community members have SFT as only a transient or minor activity. If the new organization can show benefits for them, it will strengthen the effort.
