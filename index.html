<p><br></p>
<p>Life science is rapidly increasing in interdisciplinarity, making <a href="definitions#career-spanning" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="career-spanning learning">career-spanning learning</a> critical. New methods and deeper research questions require scientists and educators to traverse widening skill gaps to remain competent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>STEM Careers and the Changing Skill Requirements of Work</strong>  -  Deming &amp; Noray, NBER 2019<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" title="1">1</a></sup></p>
<p><em>[O]ver time, new technologies replace the skills and tasks originally learned by older graduates, causing them to experience flatter wage growth and eventually exit the STEM workforce. Faster technological progress creates a greater sense of shortage, but it is the new STEM skills that are scarce, not the workers themselves.</em></p>
<p><em>[S]ince technological progress erodes the value of these skills over time, the long-run payoff to STEM majors is likely much smaller than short-run comparisons suggest. More generally, the labor market impact of rapid technological change depends critically on the extent to which schooling and
“lifelong learning” can help build the skills of the next generation.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="definitions#short-format-training-sft" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Short-format training (SFT)">Short-format training (<abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr>)</a> — including workshops, bootcamps, and short courses — is a solution many turn to. However, the effectiveness of short-format training is lower than many realize.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Null effects of boot camps and short-format training for PhD students in life sciences</strong>  -  Feldon et.al., PNAS 2017<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" title="2">2</a></sup></p>
<p><em>To increase the effectiveness of graduate research training, many universities have introduced boot camps and bridge programs lasting several days to several weeks. National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health currently support such interventions with nearly $28 million in active awards. Previous evidence for the efficacy of this format exists primarily in the form of anecdotes and end-of-course surveys. Here we show that participation in such short-format interventions is not associated with observable benefits related to skill development, scholarly productivity, or socialization into the academic community. Analyzing data from 294 PhD students in life sciences from 53 US institutions, we found no evidence of effectiveness across 115 variables. We conclude that boot camps and other short formats may not durably impact student outcomes.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, short-format training is delivered without sufficient grounding in evidence-based pedagogy, and systemic inequity limits inclusion of all learners. Education sciences are clear on what should be done to optimize teaching for learning across age groups, but what is known about teaching and learning for adults — highly relevant for strengthening short-format training across the career span — is not typically brought to bear in short-format training. Rather than require all short-format training instructors to become well-versed in the cognitive and education sciences, an actionable framework that reflects these bodies of literature is needed.</p>
<p>The <em>Bicycle Principles</em> assemble education science and community experience into a framework for improving short-format training through two cyclic (hence "bi-cycle") and iterative processes.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="img/bike-graphic.png" /></p>
<h2 id="the-bicycle-principles-for-short-format-training">The Bicycle Principles for short-format training<a class="headerlink" href="#the-bicycle-principles-for-short-format-training" title="Permanent link">🚲</a></h2>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Core Principles</strong> — apply to all short-format training:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>All short-format training should...</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use <strong>Best Evidence</strong>; grounded in findings from the education sciences and
   formally evaluated instruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be <strong>Effective</strong>; provide evidence (i.e., from <a href="definitions/#assessment" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="assessment">assessment</a>, <a href="definitions/#evaluation" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="evaluation">evaluation</a>) to
   learners that they have made progress in achieving programmatic and learning goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be <strong>Inclusive</strong>; maximize the ability of all learners to
   participate in and benefit from the learning experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote <strong>Catalytic</strong> learning; prepare learners to succeed when the
   application of knowledge, skills, and abilities requires further <a href="definitions/#self-directed-learning" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="self-directed">self-directed</a> study.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Community Principles</strong> — apply when short-format training is organized by communities (e.g., institutions, organizations, professional societies) to achieve their objectives:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Communities increase the impact of short-format by working to...</strong></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p><strong>Reach</strong>: include new types and larger audiences of <em>learners</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scale</strong>: increase delivery of short-format training by new
   groups and larger numbers of <a href="definitions/#instructors-instructional-designers-and-instructional-administrators" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="instructors and instructional developers"><em>instructors and instructional developers</em></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sustain</strong>: work to maintain the availability, usability,
   relevance, and reliability of learning materials as well as supporting the supporting infrastructures, trainers, and communities which enable effective and inclusive training.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-principles-and-this-website"><em>The Principles</em> and this website<a class="headerlink" href="#the-principles-and-this-website" title="Permanent link">🚲</a></h2>
<p><strong>Use <em>The Principles</em> as a roadmap to improved short-format training</strong></p>
<p>We believe improving short-format training enables learners to pursue the most impactful science and achieve their personal career goals.</p>
<p><em>The Principles</em> formalize effective practices and recognize the need for short-format training to be inclusive, equitable, and career-spanning.</p>
<p>Applying <em>The Principles</em> to short-format training could accelerate scientific progress while broadening participation.</p>
<p><strong>Describe and prioritize recommendations that implement <em>The Principles</em></strong></p>
<p>The Banbury Working Group (described below) developed an initial set of <a href="recommendations-intro/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="14 recommendations">14 recommendations</a> that can be used to implement <em>The Principles</em>. Each recommendation describes benefits to learners, incentives for implementers, and barriers to implementation. An anonymous survey asks stakeholders to comment on and rate recommendations and their features.</p>
<p><strong>Promote community to support implementation</strong></p>
<p>We hope to attract a diverse group of stakeholders with experience relevant to instruction (short-format and otherwise). Our efforts will draw on educational research, the experience and needs of the global community, as well as a diversity of disciplines, career stages, career paths, and cultural contexts. The <a href="feedback/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="feedback forum">feedback forum</a> and <a href="feedback#subscribe-to-mailing-list" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="mailing list">mailing list</a> are two additional ways we invite everyone to participate.</p>
<p>We strive to include new groups in implementing, adapting, and adopting existing and future recommendations that support <em>The Principles</em>. Building community and <a href="definitions/#community-of-practice" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="community of practice">community of practice</a> around <em>The Principles</em> could ensure the recommendations move from theory to adoption.</p>
