<h3 id="summary">Summary:<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">üö≤</a></h3>
<p><strong>Most short-format training instructors and instructional designers must develop and maintain their own assessments and evaluation programs. Centralizing assessment and evaluation can reduce duplicated efforts while improving quality and allowing for flexibility to meet local needs.</strong></p>
<p>Learner <a href="../definitions/#assessment" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="assessment">assessment</a> and program <a href="../definitions/#evaluation" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="evaluation">evaluation</a> are important for effective instruction, but there are many barriers to implementing these in <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr>. Centralizing infrastructure (i.e., human expertise, software, and technology) for <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> assessment and evaluation could promote consistency within and across programs and instructors. Centralization could also promote use of both formal assessment and evaluation, while reducing burden on individual instructors and instruction designers. This effort could include repositories of resources for assessment and evaluation design, online tools, question banks, help desks, etc., for use in <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> contexts.</p>
<h3 id="how-might-this-work">How might this work:<a class="headerlink" href="#how-might-this-work" title="Permanent link">üö≤</a></h3>
<p><abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> instructors and instructional designers could use or contract with, a centralized assessment and evaluation resource to help them determine their objectives and needs. Consultation would generate recommendations on resources (e.g., assessment activities or items, evaluation methods or instruments), highlighting their relevance and utility. Web services  could also support long-term assessment, follow up, and evaluation. <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> participants could be directed to online tools to provide feedback using validated methods. Instructors would then receive actionable feedback reports to improve their teaching <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" title="1">1</a></sup>,  and additional consultation if needed. Insights generated could also be used to report to funders.</p>
<p>Currently organizations such as <em>ELIXIR</em> and <em>Melbourne Genomics</em> use standardized question sets for diagnostic assessment and to document program effectiveness and impact in reports for stakeholders <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" title="2">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" title="3">3</a></sup> and shared efforts such as <em>NISER</em> <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" title="4">4</a></sup> have developed a centralized for undergraduate STEM evaluation. In the US, the National Institute for Learning Outcomes Assessment has also been successful at promoting learning outcomes assessment <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" title="5">5</a></sup>. There is ample evidence that a strategy that formalizes and centralizes these services could work.</p>

<li>The existence of independent, high-quality assessment and evaluation data on any given <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> will give learners confidence in the quality of the <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr>. This could help learners choose between ‚Äúcompeting‚Äù <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> options that have the same name/objectives.</li>
<li>As learners become familiar with high quality assessment and evaluation in their <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> options, they will be more likely to require these features, which will support broader adoption of this recommendation.</li>
<li>If widely adopted, learners could have a consistent and familiar approach to rating and leaving feedback for <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr>. This may also empower learners with the knowledge that their feedback can lead to changes.</li>
