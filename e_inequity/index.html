<h3 id="summary">Summary:<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">üö≤</a></h3>
<p><strong>A comprehensive and well-resourced effort to use <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> to reduce systemic inequities by broadening participation of diverse scientists and supporting their research and career goals.</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation shifts <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> from a passive resource that is available to learners to an actively deployed tool to support scientists and promote increased scientific impact. Targeted SFTs have the potential to be transformative in giving researchers an opportunity to reskill, upskill, and redefine themselves to meet their scientific and career goals. Attention has been paid to improving undergraduate curriculum and graduate training to support students that have been historically excluded from the sciences. This effort should be extended to career-spanning <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr>.</p>
<p>The disparities and obstacles these historically-excluded scientists face do not end after achieving high levels of professional accreditation (e.g., PhD degree). For example, in the United States, graduates receiving PhDs from minority-serving institutions (which are generally under-resourced) are less likely to have academic positions than those who received their PhD from a majority-serving institution <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" title="1">1</a></sup>. <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> can be used to empower researchers whose formal training did not include  skills that have become critical to current research aims.</p>
<p>All scientists could benefit when <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> is deployed as part of a long-term disciplinary strategy (i.e., STEM disciplines support continued professional development as a norm, such as in medicine), rather than only for the support of ‚Äújust-in-time‚Äù skills (i.e., workshops are developed for one-off specific needs without long-term planning for career-spanning needs).</p>
<h3 id="how-might-this-work">How might this work:<a class="headerlink" href="#how-might-this-work" title="Permanent link">üö≤</a></h3>
<p>Professional societies, funders, and other interested stakeholders would have to assess the needs that must be met within a community. This includes assessment of instructional needs (e.g., which skills are most unmet for a stakeholder group), technical/infrastructural requirements to complete the training, and equity deficiencies (e.g., which stakeholders are currently excluded from full participation and why) for the community of learners. An example was a 2019 assessment in the field of bioinformatics and data science <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" title="2">2</a></sup>. Based on the assessed needs, <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> opportunities would need to be deployed to specifically address the needs of learners. Evaluation would have to assess if the deployment is adequate in meeting learner needs and promoting equity.</p>

<li>Learners whose formal training lacked critical skills can be enabled to participate at the same level of research as learners who were prepared at more well-resourced institutions.</li>
<li>Learners who lacked access to training because of systemic or other inequities could have a mechanism to establish parity in their professional preparation.</li>

<p><strong>For Instructors and Instructional Designers</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Increased equity benefits the discipline and is rewarding.</li>
<li>Instructional designers/support can meet goals to broaden participation in their training programs.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>For All Implementers</strong></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>More scientists could perform more high-impact science  <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" title="3">3</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Deploying <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> without an intention of countering inequity may exacerbate existing issues of access and resource availability.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="barriers-to-implementation">Barriers to implementation:<a class="headerlink" href="#barriers-to-implementation" title="Permanent link">üö≤</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Funders and organizations may need to see the value of deploying <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> to counter inequity and evidence that <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> can be effective in achieving this.</li>
<li>Understanding and meeting learning needs, as well as assessing if they are met, will take significant effort. This needs to be done with the direction and guidance of those who have been historically excluded, not built for them without their input.</li>
