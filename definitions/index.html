    <h1 id="glossary-and-definitions">Glossary and Definitions</h1>
<h2 id="career-spanning">Career-Spanning</h2>
<p>In our context, learning across all stages of a career. This can take the form of continued professional development and training that takes place after a terminal degree (e.g., BS, MS, PhD) and/or professional credential (e.g., MD). “Career spanning” is not meant to represent the age of the learner, rather, their role in their job or community.</p>
<h2 id="short-format-training-sft">Short Format Training (SFT)</h2>
<p>Short-format training involves instruction in disciplinary skills and knowledge over a relatively short duration (i.e., hours, days, or a few weeks). Rather than specifying a set number of hours, the easiest way to identify SFT is that it will be labeled as a workshop, bootcamp, short-course, or similar term. SFT generally has the following features:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Happens outside of a formal undergraduate, graduate, or other degree-granting program. Generally, SFT learners do not receive a summative grade or university course credits. Learners may be recognized as having earned “professional development” or “continuing education” credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Course content is determined by course instructors or instruction developers, not by an institutional curriculum approval process (e.g., accreditation).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Courses tend to be stand-alone, not requiring other prerequisite or subsequent SFT. There may be expectations for learner preparation or recommended prerequisite knowledge. SFT courses can be linked and can have prerequisites, but these characteristics are not enforced as they might be in a formal setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Courses are typically delivered to a group of self-selected learners who take the course because of their interest in the topic.
SFT is typically developed and delivered by domain experts outside of and separately from an institutional undergraduate/graduate coursework teaching role (if they have such a role).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The extent to which a specific SFT course meets any of the above features will vary.</p>
