    <h1> Glossary and Definitions </h1>

<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility<a class="headerlink" href="#accessibility" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Accessibility is “an umbrella term for all aspects which influence a person’s ability to function within an environment.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" title="1">1</a></sup> Put another way, accessibility is the design (and implementation) of systems, policies, processes, ways of interacting with each other, and environments to ensure that persons with disabilities have equivalent access to a given space, and therefore equivalent experiences when participating in a given activity.</p>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment<a class="headerlink" href="#assessment" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Measurement of learner knowledge, skills, attitudes, and beliefs, specifically in determining changes and gains that occur as a result of instruction. Assessment strategies can include formative (assessment during instruction - diagnostic) and summative (assessment at the conclusion of learning).</p>
<h2 id="badge">Badge<a class="headerlink" href="#badge" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>A digital credential that can be displayed (e.g., on a website, publication, course, etc.) which signifies an achievement or compliance with a standard by an individual or organization.</p>
<h2 id="banbury-working-group">Banbury Working Group<a class="headerlink" href="#banbury-working-group" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.bikeprinciples.org/##banbury-working-group" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Attendees">Attendees</a> at the 2021/22 virtual and in-person Banbury meetings (Making Career-spanning Learning in the Life Sciences Inclusive and Effective for All; December 2021, May 2022).</p>
<h2 id="community-also-disciplinary-community">Community (also disciplinary community)<a class="headerlink" href="#community-also-disciplinary-community" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>A group of people united by a feeling of fellowship as a result of sharing common attitudes, interests, and goals <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" title="4">4</a></sup>. In our context, this often refers to scientific disciplinary communities which are linked to an area of study and related challenges. These communities work together to build knowledge and solutions. An individual can be a member of multiple communities at once.</p>
<h2 id="community-of-practice">Community of Practice<a class="headerlink" href="#community-of-practice" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>A group of people who come together around a common skill, interest, or discipline in order to learn from and support others as well as improve their abilities and skills. Communities of practice often include exchange of experience, ideas or resources, as well as collective building of knowledge and solutions to shared challenges or needs. Communities of practice may take on collaborative tasks together to move the field forward.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation<a class="headerlink" href="#evaluation" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The formal process of determining the overall effectiveness of an educational program in achieving its objectives.</p>
<h2 id="career-spanning">Career-Spanning<a class="headerlink" href="#career-spanning" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>In our context, learning across all stages of a career. This can take the form of continued professional development and training after a terminal degree (e.g., BSc, MSc, PhD) and/or professional credentials. “Career spanning” is not meant to reflect the age of the learner, but rather, their role(s) in their job or community over time.</p>
<h2 id="catalytic-learning">Catalytic Learning<a class="headerlink" href="#catalytic-learning" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Catalytic learning is defined as learning that prepares the learner to continue/implement new knowledge and positions learners for future self-directed learning. Catalytic learning is a construct<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" title="3">3</a></sup> that arises from a synthesis of long-standing, wide ranging bodies of literature on how adults learn/how learning happens. Specifically, catalytic learning is a function of metacognition, schema theory, and sustainable learning. This means that what is known about these core sources of knowledge can be leveraged to strengthen short format training (SFT), as well as any other adult learning context.</p>
<h2 id="equity">Equity<a class="headerlink" href="#equity" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Equity is the fair and respectful treatment of all persons in a given environment. Equity in instruction involves the creation of accessible opportunities, as well as the reduction of disparities in opportunities and outcomes for diverse communities. Equity provides a framework upon which inclusion is built.</p>
<h2 id="funders-and-organizations">Funders and Organizations<a class="headerlink" href="#funders-and-organizations" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Private, public, or governmental science funding agencies who support SFT with funding or infrastructure. Organizations - which also fund budgets for SFT - could include academic institutions, professional societies, or private corporations.</p>
<h2 id="inclusion">Inclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#inclusion" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Inclusion is the result of creating an environment where everyone feels welcome, valued and respected, with equitable opportunity for participation.</p>
<h2 id="inclusive-instruction">Inclusive (instruction)<a class="headerlink" href="#inclusive-instruction" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Instruction that creates a learning environment where everyone feels welcome, valued and respected, with equitable opportunity for participation.</p>
<h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure<a class="headerlink" href="#infrastructure" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Resources that are organized to support SFT. These could be human infrastructures (e.g., communities of practice, trainers, specialists, program administrators), knowledge infrastructures (e.g., lesson content, assessment instruments), computational (e.g., internet, software, computer systems), or other systems.</p>
<h2 id="instructors-instructional-designers-and-instructional-support">Instructors, Instructional Designers, and Instructional Support<a class="headerlink" href="#instructors-instructional-designers-and-instructional-support" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Instructors</em> - An instructor is an individual who delivers SFT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Instructional designers</em> - Those involved in planning and developing/adapting SFT to ensure content aligns with the goal and learning objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Instructional support</em> - Those who recruit, train, and organize instructors, hosting or advertising for SFT, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: in some cases, individuals may fill one or more of these roles simultaneously.</p>
<h2 id="knowledge-skills-and-abilities">Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities<a class="headerlink" href="#knowledge-skills-and-abilities" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<h2 id="pedagogy">Pedagogy<a class="headerlink" href="#pedagogy" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The profession and art of teaching. Relevant for SFT, pedagogy can include special attention to features of adult (post-formal education), learners (andragogy), and student-centered and self-determined learning (heutagogy<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" title="2">2</a></sup>).</p>
<h2 id="microcredential">Microcredential<a class="headerlink" href="#microcredential" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>A competency-based credential certifying a pre-specified level of performance competency in a focused area of study. These can be considered “mini-degrees” and may or may not be associated with course credit.</p>
<h2 id="self-directed-learning">Self-directed learning<a class="headerlink" href="#self-directed-learning" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Self-directed learning means the individual is in charge of planning what to learn, how to learn it, and how to assess their learning. This learning happens at the learner's own initiative as they seek out new opportunities to expand on what they’ve learned.</p>
<h2 id="short-format-training-sft">Short-format Training (SFT)<a class="headerlink" href="#short-format-training-sft" title="Permanent link">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Short-format training involves instruction in disciplinary skills and knowledge over a relatively short duration (i.e., hours, days, or a few weeks). Rather than specifying a set number of hours, the easiest way to identify SFT is that it will be labeled as a workshop, bootcamp, short-course, or similar term. SFT generally has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Happens outside of a formal undergraduate, graduate, or other degree-granting
  program. Generally, SFT learners do not receive a summative grade or university course credits. SFT may also include post-degree training programs for professional accreditation (e.g., physicians or medical specialists training for fellowship exams in a specialty). Learners may be recognized as having earned “professional development” or “continuing education” credit.</li>
<li>Content is determined by instructors or instructional designers, not
  necessarily by an institutional or professional society curriculum approval process (e.g., accreditation).</li>
<li>Tends to be stand-alone, not requiring formal  prerequisites or required
  subsequent SFT. There may be expectations for learner preparation or recommended prerequisite knowledge. SFT can be linked and can have prerequisites, but these characteristics are not enforced as they might be in a formal setting.</li>
<li>Typically delivered to a group of learners who enroll because of their
  interest in the topic, rather than a mandate.</li>
<li>Typically developed and delivered by domain experts outside of and separately
  from an institutional undergraduate/graduate coursework teaching role (if they have such a role).</li>
</ul>
<p>The extent to which a specific SFT course meets any of the above features will vary.</p>
