    <H1> A. Professionalize the training of short-format training instructors and instructional designers </H1>

<h3 id="summary">Summary:<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">üö≤</a></h3>
<p><strong>Creating a professional society(ies) or communities of practice dedicated to <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> could support instructors, instructional designers, and instructional supporters as well as helping to extend the reach of the <em>Bicycle Principles</em>.</strong></p>
<p><a href="../definitions/#instructors-instructional-designers-and-instructional-administrators" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Instructors, instructional designers, and instructional administrators">Instructors, instructional designers, and instructional administrators</a> could benefit from the services provided by professional societies (e.g., a venue for self-identification, shared affiliation; dissemination of work; development of practice; rewarding of outstanding contributions). Instead of being a ‚Äúspecial interest group" splintered from a specific professional society, this could be an independent, cross cutting, professional community. Such a group can promote appreciation for the professional competency of effective <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> instructors. It could also positively influence the entire scientific community by promoting effective and accessible training principles worldwide. Such a group could focus on training to assist <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> instructors and instructional designers to reach specific standards. Since most professional associations already have instruction-focused special interest groups, there is evidence many people would be interested. Furthermore, existing but unconnected groups around the world already have formal, iteratively-improving, trainer-training programs in which new instructors engage.</p>
<h3 id="how-might-this-work">How might this work:<a class="headerlink" href="#how-might-this-work" title="Permanent link">üö≤</a></h3>
<p>A <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> training professional society could be jointly established by organizations and/or projects that have significant <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> interest, expertise, and activity. As a community of practice, the society could: I) vet, curate, and/or maintain centralized resources ; II) work to clarify and address significant challenges, and; III) share innovations for the delivery of effective, inclusive, and career-spanning <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr>. Like most professional societies there could be virtual and in-person convenings, topical or geographical sections, and various communication mechanisms. Participation in this community would support recognition of peers, and the strengthening and promotion of <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> teaching competencies.</p>
<p>Success for this new professional society would look like a growing membership base and the co-production of actionable artifacts for others to reuse  (e.g., recommendations, guidelines, methods). The unique mission of  this society is its emphasis on improving the consistency and quality of <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> training, at the level of the individual instructor and instructional designers as a profession. Individuals from diverse scientific disciplines could join this society to signal their commitment to effective, inclusive <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> instruction.</p>

<li>More high-quality instructors trained by the society increase the chance of meeting learner demand for <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr>.</li>

<p><strong>For Instructors</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Recognition of their role and its importance in the scientific community, peer support, and increased sense of community. Professionalization may counter the perception that <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> (which is often delivered at no cost to learners) is not of ‚Äúreal value‚Äù.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>For Instructors, Instructional Designers, Instructional Supporters</strong></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Collective impact could help disseminate effective practices and enhance the adoption of practices that individual instructors or <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> programs might have difficulty implementing alone.  </li>
<li>Opportunities to develop new, better, and sustainable, economic models for <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> as well as models for applying community <em>Bicycle Principles</em> (i.e., <em>Reach</em>, <em>Scale</em>, <em>Sustain</em>).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>For Funders and Organizations</strong></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Working with an <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> professional society may strengthen justifications for <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> funding and allow funders to interact with multiple programs through a single group. The professionalization of instructors brings value to <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> provided by organizations.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="barriers-to-implementation">Barriers to implementation:<a class="headerlink" href="#barriers-to-implementation" title="Permanent link">üö≤</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>There must be enough global grassroots support to form such an organization, and this requires clear value propositions for members and financial sponsors <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" title="4">4</a></sup>.</li>
<li>There are legal, logistical, and financial barriers to launching an entirely new organization. It may be possible for existing organizations and nonprofits to help builders leverage existing resources and groups.</li>
<li>To be successful, this organization will have to demonstrate significant and positive effects on the community of instructors and instruction developers. Many of these community members have <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> as only a transient or minor activity. If the new organization can show benefits for them, it will strengthen the effort.</li>
