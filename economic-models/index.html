<h3 id="summary">Summary:<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">ðŸš²</a></h3>
<p><strong>Make compensation (financial or otherwise) of instructors a default consideration when budgeting/designing training.</strong></p>
<p>The relationship between <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr>, unpaid labor, and free access for all should be explored to identify areas to increase equity for both learners and instructors, while also addressing issues of sustainability.</p>
<p><abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> has a complex relationship between its value, accessibility, and costs of delivery. <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> delivered to learners for free increases its accessibility. However, free training may be undervalued and viewed as lower in quality. Conversely, when fees are required some learners will be excluded if they or their institutions cannot or will not pay. Volunteer instructors must have career positions or financial ability to offer their time. Institutions must figure out how to sustain training programs beyond grant funding.</p>
<p>These issues have been explored in other academic practices such as publication <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" title="1">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" title="2">2</a></sup> and this work could be translated into the <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> context. Insights into the costs, trade-offs, and pay-offs could reveal ways to avoid amplifying structural inequities involved in <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> as commonly organized. More equitable compensation (financial or otherwise) can reduce inequity. For example, volunteer service work is often subject to gender bias <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" title="3">3</a></sup>, and addressing this could support greater equity.</p>
<p>While clarifying the economics of <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> is unlikely solve all problems immediately, these insights will make it easier for those who are working to do so.</p>
<h3 id="how-might-this-work">How might this work:<a class="headerlink" href="#how-might-this-work" title="Permanent link">ðŸš²</a></h3>
<p>Taking current literature and consensus practices into consideration can help decision makers justify additional resourcing to combat inequity by centering compensation for labor in developing and carrying out training. These recommendations could help funders to justify additional resourcing to combat inequity. In the scientific publishing enterprise, paid peer review has been an actively debated subject <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" title="4">4</a></sup>. However, <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> is unlikely to encounter the potential conflicts of interest that have arisen in the scientific publishing domain.</p>

<li>Sustainable economic models could make <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> available to more learners. If <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> is adequately funded, it may also be available for a longer duration.</li>
<li>If <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> is less reliant on unpaid labor, a greater diversity of instructors may participate, increasing the diversity of viewpoints, approaches, and styles of instruction, heightening the potential for inclusion.</li>
<li>Learners may more highly value training if they understand its value in economic terms, even when that training is made available to them at a subsidized price.</li>

<p><strong>For Instructors</strong></p>

<li>Instructors could be adequately compensated for their work; this compensation may be financial, or through other forms of support or recognition.</li>

<ol start="2">
<li>Clearer understanding of the total set of resources needed to sustain a <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> program.</li>
<li>Adequately compensating instructors for their work can increase the number of people willing and able to develop and deliver <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr></li>
<li>Including compensation for courses and instructors can provide greater accountability for ensuring <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> is of good quality.</li>

<li>Financial compensation could be challenging to implement in some circumstances (e.g. where <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> occurs across national boundaries; using instructors working in positions where they are unable to accept traditional forms of compensation).</li>
