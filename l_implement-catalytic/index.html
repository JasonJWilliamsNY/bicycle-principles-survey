    <H1>  L. Develop an implementation strategy for <em>Catalytic</em> Learning </H1>

<h3 id="summary">Summary:<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">üö≤</a></h3>
<p><strong>Instructors implementing a <em>Catalytic</em> learning approach explicitly prepare learners to learn on their own topics that can't be covered in the scope of a course, including topics that need updating over time.</strong></p>
<p><a href="../definitions/#catalytic-learning" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Catalytic learning"><em>Catalytic</em> learning</a> is a new construct based on existing educational research. Although there is a strong evidence base for <em>Catalytic</em> learning <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" title="1">1</a></sup>, a strategy for implementing and ensuring <em>Catalytic</em> learning in <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> is needed. Instructors will need training in applying <em>Catalytic</em> learning strategies, including guidelines to determine when it applies (i.e., career shifting vs ‚Äújust-in-time‚Äù training), and how to integrate the strategies effectively. Formalized assessment of resulting learning, and evaluation of instruction, will also need development. While <em>Catalytic</em> learning hasn‚Äôt been deployed <em>per se</em>, all the literature around each of the sub-constructs of <em>Catalytic</em> learning are well supported suggesting this synthesis can be successful.</p>
<h3 id="how-might-this-work">How might this work:<a class="headerlink" href="#how-might-this-work" title="Permanent link">üö≤</a></h3>
<p>Frequently, when learners attempt to implement what was covered in <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr>, they realize they cannot apply that new knowledge, skill, or ability to the problems they need to solve. Instructors applying <em>Catalytic</em> learning principles in their training include specific strategies that help learners integrate new learning into their existing knowledge as well as successfully identify and fill in gaps.</p>
<p>Learners will be empowered to clarify what <a href="../definitions/#self-directed-learning" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="self-directed">self-directed</a> learning they will need to expand and maintain their knowledge (e.g., self-study, additional training), guidance on how to identify learning opportunities that match their needs, and tools to self-assess their progress. A <em>Catalytic</em> learning focus in <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> instruction will result in an actionable post-<abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> plan for learners to apply the <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> learning or continue additional learning. As learners become self-directed in a new topic, they may find it easier to participate in a new disciplinary community.</p>
<p>Instructors will be able to ensure the <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> has a high likelihood of achieving the level of competency a learner needs to accomplish their task. Instructors and instructional designers can collaborate with education specialists (who can plan effective evaluation as well) to develop tools that prepare instructors and learners to share responsibility for learning.</p>

<li>A larger proportion of learners are better prepared to anticipate, and then work through, obstacles to implementing <abbr title="Short Format Training - See also glossary and definitions">SFT</abbr> learnings into professional practice.</li>
<li>Advanced learning will be/be perceived as more achievable for learners.</li>
<li>Learners can to successfully self-monitor and self-direct, encouraging navigation of topics in new disciplinary areas.  </li>

<p><strong>For Instructors and Instructional Designers</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Instructors/designers using <em>Catalytic</em> learning can feel more confident that learners will achieve learning outcomes and can generate evidence that this is occurring.</li>
<li>An expert-developed strategy for instructors/designers would make <em>Catalytic</em> learning <em>theory</em> into <em>ready-to-use tools</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>For Funders and Organizations</strong></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Learners are more likely to provide actionable feedback (from evaluation) about the impact of implementing <em>Catalytic</em> learning.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="barriers-to-implementation">Barriers to implementation:<a class="headerlink" href="#barriers-to-implementation" title="Permanent link">üö≤</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Development of an implementation strategy will take energy, time, funding, and several types of expertise.</li>
<li>The theoretical grounding of this approach is well-established, but knowledge translation has been lacking <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" title="2">2</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Many individualized strategies for <em>Catalytic</em> learning may be needed to ensure that recommendations for instructors are accessible and effective experiences for diverse learners and characteristics (e.g., career stage, cultural context, ability).</li>
