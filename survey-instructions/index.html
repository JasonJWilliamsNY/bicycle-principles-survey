<h2 id="survey-instructions">Survey instructions<a class="headerlink" href="#survey-instructions" title="Permanent link">ðŸš²</a></h2>
<p>Each recommendation is followed by an anonymous two-question survey asking you identify as a stakeholder with respect to short-format training (e.g., a learner, instructor) and to give your rating of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Benefits of the recommendation to learners</li>
<li>Incentives to those who might implement the recommendation</li>
<li>Barriers to implementing the recommendation</li>
<li>How likely it is that you would support implementing this recommendation</li>
</ul>
<p>Each survey question is independent so you may answer the survey question for as many or as few of the recommendations as you like.</p>
<h2 id="who-should-take-this-survey">Who should take this survey?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-should-take-this-survey" title="Permanent link">ðŸš²</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Anyone who designs, delivers, supports, or attends short-format training in the life sciences. This includes life science researchers, educators, and students at the postgraduate level.
 (i.e., completed undergraduate degree)</li>
<li>You must be age 18 or above.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="purpose-of-the-survey">Purpose of the survey<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose-of-the-survey" title="Permanent link">ðŸš²</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this survey is to get broad perspectives on 14 recommendations to improve short-format training in the life sciences. Feedback from the survey could help prioritize recommendations by various stakeholders.</p>
<h2 id="consent-and-approximate-time">Consent and approximate time<a class="headerlink" href="#consent-and-approximate-time" title="Permanent link">ðŸš²</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Each recommendation is followed by two survey questions. We estimate it will take about 5 minutes to read each recommendation and answer the questions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="who-is-conducting-this-survey">Who is conducting this survey?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-is-conducting-this-survey" title="Permanent link">ðŸš²</a></h2>
<p>This survey is being conducted by Jason Williams (williams @ cshl.edu) of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory NY and Rochelle Tractenberg (rochelle.tractenberg @ georgetown.edu), and is sponsored by an award from the US National Science Foundation (NSF DRL#2027025).</p>

<p><strong>Will I be compensated for, or benefit from, my participation?</strong></p>
<p>There is no compensation for your participation in this survey. We do not anticipate benefits directly for participants, but we intend the survey to strengthen all short-format training and thereby, to ultimately benefit all participants.</p>
<p><strong>What am I consenting to and are there any risks to my participation?</strong></p>
<p>Participation in this survey is voluntary. We anticipate no risks to participants, and we assume no liability for your participation.</p>
<p><strong>What is the privacy policy and how will the responses be used?</strong></p>
<p>Responses will be collected anonymously. We ask that you do not provide any personal or identifying information in any free-response answer. Any such information will be removed from the collected data prior to analysis. Only fully de-identified data will be shared with the study statistician (Rochelle Tractenberg). Once you submit a response, that data will remain in the data file, even if you choose to withdraw from the survey.</p>
<p><strong>How will results from this survey be shared?</strong></p>
<p>By participating in this survey you are consenting to sharing of de-identified response data. The results of this survey (with all identifiable information removed) will be summarized to the community. We anticipate summarizing results in blog posts, peer-reviewed publications, and elsewhere. All data will be made available under a CC-By Attribution 4.0 International license through the Open Science Framework, https://osf.io/nqzdp/ and in other formats under the same license. We have obtained an IRB Institutional Review Board exemption from Georgetown University (IRB00019291).
